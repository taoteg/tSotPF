### DAY 19B (2021.10.02)

We decide to explore below the manor.
We find goblin centurions in the rooms across the small ravine in the first level.
We use fenster to dientify teh enemies and decided to lure them out.
On our way up the stairs to prepare, XP and TH failed their sneak check and drew attention to the party.
The goblins come running!

##### END BATTLE

We loot thier corpses, but they have little of value.
Some old wepaons and a few coins.

20 SP
1 GP

We investigate the rooms and find croicery and wine in the upper room, and simply old beds in the lower room.

We descend further into the second level of the Bardcore Manor cellars. It is much as w left it, littered with the spider webs and the strange toxic mushrooms we encountered earlier. The party moves to the center of the underground caver where the healing fountain burbles, and XP drinks from the waters to regain his maximum hitpoints.

The party cautiously moves deeper into teh rear of the cavern, where we had stopped explorng before. As MC ascends the stairs to a rocky outcropping he sees the dessicated corpses of goblins, thier crumpled skin falling in upon the now juiceless bones of their carcass, littered about the ground. A fetid odor of decay emanates forth. Looking into the depths of the room MC can see the gigantic hairy legs of what must be a gargantuan spider.

<< We pause here because its late and TH's internet was acting up. Next time, XP will be in our time zone again! ]>>

### DAY 19C (2021.10.16)

MC sends Fenster as a bat down the hallway to explore.
He rolls a Nat 20 and passes the spiders and webbing unexposed or touched.
As he rounds the corner he sees a large chamber, with a blood pool of ichor and decay in the center.
Several orclike creatures are visible around the room, and two enormous ogres.
Spiders, Orcs and Ogres, oh my!!

MC commands Fenster to hang upside down above the cave and listen quietly.
MC casts Comprehend Languages on himself and listens through Fensters bat ears.

The Ogres appear to be middle management over the Orcs, the prce pushing back due to language differences.
The Ogres repeat themselves frequently, trying to get Orcs to tidy up the cavern faster.
Push stuff into the pit (remains and trash) into the blood pit.
The smaller and larger ogre also are talking, the smaller trying to usurp the dominance ofg the larger periodically.
The larger throws boulders at the smaller, while the Orcs mutter curses under their breath.

We coordinate a complex scheme to contrive a fiught a battler between the ogres and orcs.
For our brilliant plan we get INSPIRATION!!!
MC sneaks up and cast amage hand, throwing sa ston efrom behind the little ogre at the big one, hopefully sdtarting a fight.
If tat fails we withdraw to the healing well room, toss some lanterns and ignite them and then setup an iron door to block the passage way.

A small spider scurries down the wall as MC takes up posirtion by the stairs into the blood pit antechamber.

##### BATTLE

_Initiaitive_

TH 10
Spider ?
MC 4
XP 2
DB 1

##### ROUND 1

TH tries to lure the spider towartds him so we can silently kill it.
Spider shoots webbing at Xanku and sticks him in place.
MC uses his mage hand and hurls a rock from behind the closest orc at the large ogre.
It barely taps him in the leg, but he turns and looks at the smaller ogre.
However he then stares at the smaller orc in the background, noticing a shimmering mage hand in teh background.
He lurches to his feet as MC dispells the hand and withdraws back into the chamber next to Xanku.
MC pulls out his bow and takes guard.
XP tries to escape from the webbing but fails.
DB casts a sacred flame on the spider, hitting it for 7 RADIANT DAMAGE, bloodying it badly.

##### ROUND 2

TH moves up next to Xanku and takes up defense.
Spider attacks his prey, taking a bite out of Xanku for 7 PIERCING DAMAGE, but escapes poisoning.
MC shoots the spider, hitting for 26 points DMG (7 + 1 + 18 (2x6 Sneak Attack)) and killing it.

##### END BATTLE

We withdraw quickly into the healing chamber room,. MC bringing the spider corpse with him to avoid sdetection.
Xanku drinks and heals for 10, fully restored to his former glory.
We pause here, discussing strategies to use our friendship is real tattoos to lure the creatures into a pincer trap where we can block them in place, using the iron door from the coat of useful items and cloud of daggers to damage them all badly.
Ideally lure them into a cul de sac where we can seal them all into a small space, seal them in and decimate them with spells and ranged attacks.

<< We _might_ play on Halloween OCT 31, possibly a late game after Trick-or-Treating is over, OR we might skip and pick up a game the following week of NOV 7 (out of cycle) - depending on availability. If not, we will pick back up on the usual week of NOV 14. >>

### DAY 19E (2021.11.06)

**What has become of Morthos??**

...Resume tale

- 1 GP
- 11 SP
- 1 Sapphire

We explore the blood room, rolling for percpetion.
Xanku rolled a 1, falling over the railing above the bllod pit and falling head ifrst into 5 feet of blood and gristle.
He pushes off the bottom of the pit and swims forward, emerging about 12 feet away from the edge in a subterranean cavern.
This seems to be the source of the creatures emerging into our underground.
He calls back to Thorune with a sending stone and tells him that there is more here.
Thorune tells Morthos to go help him check it out.
Morthos wades in and swims through the bloodied ooze, finding the cavernbous opening and swimmminginto it.
He follows the smooth walls up until he emerges fomr th ethickened goo, wiping his eyes clear.
He sees Xanku struggling to walk forward in the pitch black, his night vission setting in.
He rolls for perceoption (17).
The tunnel is incredibly smooth and perfectly engineered, definitely by design.
Morthos summons Fenster as a cat while Xanku tells Thorune to stand by.
Fenster goes beyond his telepathy range, about 350 feet out, nothing changes in the tunnel.
He returns and reports to Morthos.
Xanku calls Thorune and Donnabella to join us.
They walk into the blood, trying to pretend they are not disgusted.
Thorune has no major issue with it, but DB castw prestidigitation upon herself constantly until she gets though the goo.
Upon surfacing from the goo, Thorune uses his electric sword and illuminates the tunnel for 15-30'.
DB cleans everyone up with her spell again, mending and cleaning all our gear.
In the light, we see nothing new, just polished stone but that is all.
Morthos lights a torch and stands it against teh wall, about 30 feet from the blood pools edge.
Thorune holds up his sword, and the party begins to journey down the tunnel.
The ambient light at the end of the tunnel ahead leads us onward, feeling endless, like a loop.
At about 100 feet, Morthos drops another lit torch for reference.
We continue onward, the dark tunnel seemingly staying equidistant.
Morthos stops at the next 100 feet and casts Detect Magic.
He does not see any creatures or objects.
However, aside from the magical light from Thorune's sword, there are other fields of color bleeding into his sense of space.
His vision is tinegd wiht kaleidescopic coplors, but nothign distinct enought to identify.
Thorune senses something trying to connect with his mind.
Thorune tells Donnabella what he feel and ask if she feel it too?
DB says aside from the standard creepy factor, no.
Thorune tells the rest of the party.
Morthos asks Thorune if it is because he is Dragonborne?
Thorune casts perception (rolls a 16), and suddenly begins to see through the eyes of the White Dragon's eyes...
flashes of visions, from the perspective of the dragon, seeing our encounter from before, and feeling the words we spoke...
Thorune becomes self aware again, returning to the tunnel and the group.
Thorune tells us of his vision.
We try to identify what it could mean?
"A thousand feet deep ina magic tunnel"
We continue on to see if the sensations get stronger or change.
As we get to about 350 feet, with Morthos dropping torches every 100 feet, another vision comes over Thorune (rolls a 12).
He sees a fuzzy/blurry image of the group close to a body of water in a thick forest, walking the banks...
Morthos asks if it felt liek a memory or a foretelling?
Mystical magical drone footage...
The party presses on to about 400 feet and Morthos puits down another torch.
About 500 feet in Thorune has another vision (rolls a 17), and begins to see...
....on a small road walkig into a small village, the party approaching Coneyberry on ythe Tribore Trail (viewing is from the south)...
... Thorune recalls Xanku seeing a peripheral flash of color as we passed through teh village, now Thorune sees it as a dark energy, a void of red and black nothingness,
a pinhole tear burning bright with incredible power, an artifact burned into an image, a retinal remain from a bright light...
...the group moves across a bridge to town... the light shoots away (as Xanku says "I want to shoot an arrow at it.. at it... at it...")
Thorune comes back, a little unstable - relaying his vision to the group.
Xanku shoots an arrow down the tunnel, about 85 feet down it suddenly reverses course and comes back, skidding at our feet.
Morthos sends Fentser down the tunnel to see what happens.
Close to the 80' mark, Fentser senses anunseen strangeness.
At the same time, Thorune is beset with a vision of the group, this time seeing us from behind in the tunnel we are in now, by about 100 feet.
Thorune tells the group.
Meanwhile, Fenster is moving forward, tense and aware but not terrified.
As he crosses the threshold, nothgin happens, he just walks on.
The group follows to see if there are more visions.
We roll for perception (TH-19, XP-14, MC-12, DB-5)...
...the entire group recognizes that the light of the sword perceptually dims, to be replaced with a soft but bright blue hue coming from before us...
...it projects holographically into the tunnel, an image of the great white dragon, not physically but filling our vision enourmously in the tunnel...
... the dragon happily and wisely gestures in welcome, no verbal contact but a sense of greater connection...
Thorune tries to connect: "Greeting Great Dragon" in Draconic...
the rest of us hear muffled echoes as the Dragon responds to us: "Greetings friend..."
Xanku asks "Did you summon us here?"
The dragon thinks then says "Not summoned as much as guided to lookunder your house"
Xanku and MC ask "Are we stuck ina tunnel?"
"Yes and no, you are in a physical level of tunnel under your house, but there are illusions that guard my location under Phandolin."
MC: "Why does this tunnel lead to a blood pit?"
Dragon: "There are many tunnels under the city, a network of subterranean systems beneath the realm. This is but an entryway to the path where I reside."
Thorune: "What would you have us do now?"
Dragon: "Listen and Speak, or Speak and Listen"
MC: "Great Dragon, we cleared the tunnels under the house, is there further dangersd ot clear? Are there other tunnels we shoudl seek out?"
Dragon: "Please, it is McQuaid, Morthos. The entirety of the kingdom is connected through tunnels in one form or another."
MC: Who made these tunnels? How old are they?"
XP: "Why odo they exits?"
McQuaid: "They predate Dragon oral history, they have just always existed."
XP: "Is there a danger?"
McQ: "There is a real danger osed to all who exist within this realm..."
MC: "What is the nature of the threat from beyond these tunnels?"
Thorune sees a visual of time-space imagery as nautilus shells, curling in on noe anotgher, layer upn layer, unique to each position within the cosmos and reality. McQ is attempting to convey the abstracty interconneciton of the cosmic reality, yet emphasize a more imediate threat to this realm based on the geo-political struggle in NeverWinter and the surrounding areas (the Dead Hand Organization vs. Leia and the Veil), their conflict poses a risk... but we have been led here, the fleein creatures you have seen, detected and encountered is a result of the coming threat that is immediately posed to this world.
The group appreciates the localized threat in NeverWinter, Thorune is the only one that clearly perceives the grander scale of the threat...
Thorune ask if we can call on the dragon without the use of the tunnels?
McQ says as of now, this is more of an antenna than a doorway... _a vision of the fountain above flashes to us_
Thorune ask McQ about the blip, the vision we saw of the village and the mystery of what we saw near Coneyberry...
McQ says it is like a cosmic peephole, but knows not who is looking through it, much less creating it.
MC asks if going to the Dragon burial mounds will be considered a transgression or offensive?
McQ says you can't assume, but it is about the intention you have. IF you mean well and do well, you should not have a problem.
Thorune asks if we can get to other places through the tunnels?
We roll for perception (TH-18, DB-?, XP-5, MC-2)...
Only Thorune recieves a vision of a world map taht covers the Sword Coast region...
The vision of McQ begins ot recede.
We see we are within 30 feet of the blood pit...
Morthos has a pile of torches at his feet, he recovers his torches.
We swim back through the blood and goo, Donnabella cleaning us asap upon exiting the other side.
We return to the safety of the Manor above, resting soundly in our beds until the adventure continues... (on 2021.11.13)

<stop here for the week.>

### DAY 20 (2021.11.13)

NOTE: Cloak of Many Things - we used the Steel Door.
For now we go down and block the door to below the Bardcore Castle.

We decide to head North and explore the Dragon Barrow.
There is more traffic trhan usual on the King's Road as we approack the mound to the north.
We make ou way from the main trail, moving across the terrain towards the mounds.
As we approach, a mist begins to roll out from the NeverWInter Woods, heavy and thick, rolling in from the woods to the East and stretching out to the road, stopping just short of crossing.
XP: "Its colder ..."
TH: Grunts in confirmation.
DB: "The sun is at high noon..."
MC: "Visibility is low after 35 feet. Feels strange..."
DB begins to give us a history lesson on the mounds, what she has read.
As we enter the compound of hills, they grow denser.
The fog breaks, revealing a 30 foot tall earthen wall towering before us fifty feet in the distance.

Xanku takes point, moving ahead of the group about 15 feet.
Looking up he sees regular patterns at the top, like leaning stones.
The party climbs to the top of the mound, revealing a trtail of the stones leading North.
TH realizes the outline of the hill is in the shape of a slumbering (or dead) dragon, the stones sticking out of the ground resembling spines.

TH examines the stones closely, finding grooved recesses on the bottoms of them, regular grooves along the base. There are hand size holes, TH reaches slowy into one of the stones, freely reaching around in the dragons under cavity =)

TH places on his Googles of night Vision and peers into the dragon hill spinestone hole carefully...peering beyiond the fresh ancient dust, and sees stairs spiraling down into a dark antechamber within. We need to clear the earth to access them.

MC and XP examine the remainder of the mound, revealing the shape of the dragon to be the primary shape. TH is digging towards the opening he saw within, but after a short distance he encounters a stone blockage, but there is a crevace wide enough for a small thing ot enter.

MC summons Fenster as a Weasel, who crawls into the opening and descends the spiral staircase, which opens up into a tunnel that dead ends into a hallway.
Green light is visible shooting left and right, shadows flitting away.
Fenster follows the light down the hallways, but falls into a crack and disapparates from the damage.

We decide to take our chances and dig into the tunnel since we saw no obvious threat.
Xankuties a rope around the stone, morthos wedges his crowabar and they all heve to rip the blockage loose.

It tears free with a shearing noise, leaving a gaping wound in the earth )(the dragonhill has a blowhole). The party descends into the darkness.

Party Order: TH, MC, DB, XP

We see the green lights whisping in and out of existence all around us, but we do not know what they are. TH recalls a distant memory of a folk tale involving fgreen light and warning children not to stray into the woods.

We carefully move forward, but Xanku stumbles, rolling across the floor and into the same trap Fenster fell into. He takes 3 Bludgeoning DMG, also impaling himself on a sword within the trap for 3 Piercing DMG.

TH converses with DB about his recollection of the green light, DB agrees it sounds like the Fae Folk, but we still dont know what this might be.

We hear Xanku fall and the party catches up to him, revealing a room full of sarcophogi in a burial chamber. He gives us the thumbs up from the bopttom of his fall into the pit, climbing out and continuing wordlessly ahead.

He finds enormous bones in the alcove ahead, and in teh far distance sees a huge skull, with some sort of weapon resting upon is head.

TH pull forth his light sword and ignoites the room with light.
We see more bone fragments, likely a dragon's remains, and the skull.
Claw and wing formations have been used to create the very walls of the chamber.

MC carefully approaches, seeing that there is indeed an ancvient scabbarded weapon
We examine the coffins within the chamber before touching the sword.
Talamir Anagonda and her faithful (nameless) squire lie in the sarcophagai.
TH approaches teh sword to attempt it sremobal, examining the skull and sword for any switches of levers or traps.
He sees nothing obvious.

With his electric sword held aloft, TH pulls the sword so hard it yanks free of the scabbard. He goes to rescabbard it and is attacked from behind!

##### BATTLE

_Initiative_

- CREATURE: 20
- TH: 18
- XP: 6
- MC: 1
- DB: 1

#### ROUND 0 (Surprise)

CREATURE misses TH.

#### ROUND 1

CREATURE hist TH for 10 Bludgeoning DMG.
The party sees TH being attacked, dropping to one knee and turning.

TH turns and faces his attacker, but sees nothing.
He takes the swords, one in each hand, and swings them before him on two powerful arcs.
One of the swords makes contact with someting, inflicting 9 DMG on _something (female)_.

XP runs up on TH and throws a handful of dust, revealing a form in the powder-filled air.
He draws his daggers and attacks the shape, hitting it for 3 DMG.

MC runs forward, with advantage, drawing his shortsword and drops low, swinging the blade from ground to ceiling between TH and XP, hitting the invisible CREATURE for 15 SLASHING DMG, though the CREATUE only takes 7 DMG.

DB casts Sacred Flame, holding forth her hand and summoning a a spectral fire in a column that spreads over teh ground, striking the CREATURE for 4 DMG.

#### ROUND 2

CREATURE sees XP before it, shakes its body to free the clinging dust making it harder to see, and attacks him twice, striking with both attacks. It hits him for 20 DMG, dropping him to the ground.

TH assesses the moving form, identifying center mass and plunging his sword forward, finding nothing.

He tries again with the newly acquired weapon, same tack, but this time finds purchase on something unseen, inflicting 9 PIERCING DMG, the CREATURE takes 4 DMG.

TH senses an element of human movement but a physicality that seems animalistic. Whatever it is it is educated or intelligent.

XP swings his dagger and hits it for 4 DMG, but th CREATURE only takes 2 DMG, however XP COllossus Slayer Feat hits for # DMG more.

MC stabs the invisible CREATURE space between them all, hitting again for 16 PIERCING DMG, the creature taking 8 DMG.

DB casts Sacred Flame again, the column blasting the creature for 10 RADIANT (CELESTIAL) DMG. She yells to the party "Use your magic!" and moves closer.

#### ROUND 3

CREATURE steps to the left and behind XP, trying to bodyslam him, striking at him twice, missing once but hitting the second time for 9 BLUDGEONING DMG.

TH casts TRUE STRIKE and determines that the CREATURE has POISON IMMUNITY. He yells out to the group and takes a defensive posture.

XP attacks with his daggers, hitting it for 2 DMG and 4 DMG for the Collosus Slayer feat.

MC <PAUSE FOR THE WEEK>

---

### DAY 20B (2021.11.27)

MC <RESUME> Attacks with his dagger, with ADVANTAGE, hitting for 13 DMG, it takes 6.

DB asks the creature (withuot words) what is the purpose of the sword, why are you so bound to it?

Images flash in our minds, a sense of a long forgotten battle where a female warrior garbed like the cairns we seea round us, strides fiercly through battle, taking down a dragon leading a charge. Another dragon floats down to the battle field before her and the woman and dragon have a mystic meeting of minds, then join forces to face a new and larger dragon that appears on the battle field.

We suspect this might be Lady Tanamere Alagondar, the great warrior noble lady who faced down the dragon of legend.

DB holds her action, but throws more dirt on the creature to keep it visible.

#### ROUND 4

CREATURE walks around Morthos and attempts to tear the sword out of Thorune's hands, but fails, flashing an image of the sword on the skull.

TH replaces the sword and the apparition calms down, ending the battle state.

#### END BATTLE

MC asks if she is Lady Tanamere.

We see an image of a regal woman in robes doing an important thing.

TH asks if it knows the dragon McQuaid and projects an image of the dragon from his mind.

We receive the image of the battle again, the unio n of the woman warrior with a white dragon similar to McQuaid.

TH think/says McQuaid sent us here.

There is an inquisitive response, waiting.

MC think-says that we do not know why he sent us exactly, vbut there is a threat beyond this plane tat threatens the whole of never winter and the greater realm. We thought we would swing by and picm the weapon up on our way to deal with this.

Suddenly a portal opens up behind Donnabella and out steps a red skinned warrior, garbed in leather and armor and heavilly armed. He has a flowing large pompadour of hair around his two small pan-like horns.

"Where is the sword?" it demands.
"Who the fuck are you?" Morthos demands.
The visitor turns to Donnabella.
"The sword, where is it?"
Donnabella steps back to rejoin the group.
Morthos and Xanku shoulder up, blocking the path to teh sword.
Thorune steps before the sword and puts his hand on the hilt.

The visitor diminishes in stature suddenly, some illusion dispelling.
He approaches us in a more normal size, with a business like approach.

Morthos raises his sword and says "Stop and tell us who you are and why you want this sword?".

The visitor turns to Morthos and says in Infernal "Come now, we can settle our business in private, no need for these others to hear. You know what I mean?"

Morthos says in Infernal "Anythign you have to say.."
then in Common "You can say in front of my friends. Now who the fuck are you and where the fuck are you from?"

"I see, look, I am here for the sword, on behalf of a client, no questions asked, I simply want ot get the wepaon and go. SO what do we need, how about 100 Gold each and we never see each other again?"

"We do not want your money. You haven't answered any of my questions nor indicated why the hell we should care."

#### BATTLE

Visitor

#### ROUND 1

XP shoots an arrow but misses, the visitor stepping aside.

TH grabs the draonsword and instantly teleports to Donnabella, atempting to swing two handed at the visitior, but rolls double nat 1, stumbliong and swinging to hit himself and DB, inflivting 5 DMG on each of them.

MC stabs forward with his short sword, hitting for 4 slashing DMG, causing 2 DMG. MC draws his daggers and waits for his next turn.

DB armors herslef with magical armor and steps to teh side.

The Visitor wrestles with TH for the dragon blade, pulling it loos ethen drop kicking TH in the gut for 2 DMG, his dragonborne belt buckle protecting him.

#### ROUND 2

XP fires his long bow at the creature and ust hits (with 19!!), striking the visitor for 22 DMG (9 + 13). The visitor hisses at us in anger.

TH slashes down with his electric sword, but misses on both swings.

MC slashes the visitor with his daggers, hitting for 1 DMG but adding SNEAK ATTACK for +7.

The visitor is damaged, but still doing okay.

DB screams out a warning "Cloud of Daggers!". She casts it on the character, annoying him as it inflicts 11 MAGIC DMG.

The visitor thrusts his spear at TH but misses, then hurls it at MC, missing him as well.

#### ROUND 3

XP fires his bow again, but the visitor catches the arrow and tosses it to the ground.

TH swings his sword and misses the first swing, but hits again on the second, striking him for 19 DMG (a mix of sword dmg and lightning damage). The visitor is bloodied.

MC casts Fire Bolt, hitting for 14 Fire DMG, staggering the demon visitor.

DB's cloud of daggers continues to tear him up, taking another 11 DMG.

The demon looks at DB and winks before he summons his portal to drop over him and disappear.

#### BATTLE ENDS

We got Loony Tuned!

Behind MC and XP the red of the portal appears again, small but growing.
From its depths, the demon visitor is dropped back out on the ground.

TH steps on his wrist and grabs the dragonsword.
MC ties him up and we interrogate him.

He refuses to tell us who hired him or what is happening, and spits at TH.
TH punches him in the face.

"I still won't tell you anything."
TH punches him again.
"I know."

TH threatens to kill him, and he says that the people who hired him can do things to him worse than death. He'll take the death.

He tells us there are many people who want to finish off the dragons, others who want to defend them.

TH cannot kill him, but suggest to MC that he can.

TH ask him how much to will cost to make him talk.
He begins to calculate...
XP ask him "What do you want?"
The question, its profundity, strikes him.
He considers and after reflection tells us that the sword itself is not that powerful, but it is a symbol of power and could fuel a revolution.

"What is your name Demon."
"Lusan," he braces for the inevitable jokes.

We debate what to do with him, unable to decide if we should kill him or let him go. At long last, TH sits in meditation and summons a mental image of McQuaid. He transcends into an astral plane and sees McQuaid in the distance. He projects an image of the happenings to the image of McQuaid and waits. A response comes a moment later, implying that the true story is that the Lady appeared at first to the dragons as a marauder or destroyer, brutally killing a dragon. McQuaid observed this, landing ot investigate - had a psychic mind meld with the warrior and they spoke as equals - the warrior wondering why the dragons were the ancient threat, the dragon wondering why the people were always pitted against the dragons. Their exchange yielded anunderstanding of an immense green dragon killing mercilessly, rampaging the countryside like a mad beast, beyond all understanding. It fed a prejudice and folk lore that still plagues the drasgon kind. The warrior and dragon decided to join forces to stop the Green dragon, going to battle and killing the dragon eventually. The sword played a role in this, the warrior was bonded to it and it may have been a part of the communication channel with the dragon. It plays a special role in all this.

TH conveys the recent encounter with the demon, asking for guidance.

McQuaid implies it is the royal and wealthy families of the NeverWinter, TH says "Dead Hand" and she summons the image of the sigil of the eye to confirm.

TH comes out of his trance and conveys his news to the group.

We search Lusen and find:

- 2 Blue Sapphires
- Jeweled Anklet

We stuff Lusen into one of the empty sarcophogai, leaving him bound. We know he will escape, but for now he is out of our way without having ot kill him.

We take a short rest so that TH can have a sword touching session and bond with the dragonsword.

Also the party can do some healing as needed.
<BREAK>

Note: We will resume again on 2021.12.11@9pm.CST.
Note: We need to plan around Holidays and Xaiz' travel to Boston next round.

### DAY 20C (2021.12.11)

<RESUME>

Hit Dice:

- XP gets 13 HP from 3 hit dice.
- TH gets 7 HP from 1 hit dice.

TH tucks the Dragonsword in his pocket dimension.

The Invisible Stalker relays a message to TH (and the group) of the final moments of the battle between the Lady of NeverWInter and McQuaids battle with the Green Dragon. It appears to have taken a great toll on her company and numbers. The psychic link between her and McQuaid is made by the sword, allowing her to see that some dragons are menaces and monsters while others are peaceful and harmonious, living with balance. The mental link between McQuaid and the Lady from Neverwinter is a large step forward for humankind. The Lady from Neverwinter, seeing the value of dragonkind, was now at odds with the forces she represented. Sometime after that battle, she passed into the light (died).

MC thinks to the being "Do you trust us to care for and take the dragonsword now?"

Being emits a greenlight image, indicative of yes.

We decide to explore the rest of the dragon mound tunnels.

Do not take too much SugarRock or you will end up on the Jorn, high on Dukebox and burning from the Buttrocket.

**We will schedule a game in between xmas and NYE somewhere (12.26-30).**

<BREAK>

### DAY 20D (2021.12.26)

_Special Sunday Session_

We recap the vision of the battlefield shared by Jorni Mitchell (the Invisible Stalker), afterwards we notice glowing light coming form the tunnel the way we came before.
There is a blue light in the tunnel to the east, and red light from the west, with a purple hue underlying both on the sublevel.
There is a hint of movement to the East, but sound in both directions.
We decide to go west, towards the red light.
We find a glowing source of light, cycling through colors, it pauses in response to our perception of it.
MC toes around the corner, into its presence, and attempts to convey passivity (rolls NAT 20 + 6).
It holds position cautiously, but looks ready to dart in a second.
Behind the light, there is a soothing sense of attraction or calmness.
We do not know yet what to make of it.
MC says "We mean you know harm, ar eyou friend or foe?"
The colors slow in shifting, then it rises and backs away some from us.
MC steps forward cautiouslyto follow, and the floor crumbles away beneath his feet.
He avoids damage (17 + 4) and rights himself.
MC works forward cautiously and the floor gives way again.
MC smashes the floor all around, revealing a pit in the floor beneath them filled wiht sharpened spikes.
MC summons Fenster as a cat and tosses him across the opening.
Fenster explores the room and reveals four cairn crypts and a hearth burning open in the far wall.
It looks like molten fire, like a still volcano.
The orb hovers nearby waiting.
DB indicates that the other direcrtions is moving as well.
We decide to investigate the other light before crossing the trap.
We make our way slowly through the tunnel and find a similar hearth on the other side, but glowing blue like an icy magma.
There is a crack in the wall leaking a violet hue.
MC approaches it and places Fenster in the tube as a rat.
Fenster runs down the tube and disappears into the purple light.
MC sees Fenster's vision and feels a growing sense of terror.
He becomes suddenly terrified, panicked and frightened.
(Disadvantage on Attack and ability rolls while source of fear is in line of sight, cannot move closer to the source of his fear - in this case).
MC is now basically catatonic, frozen in a reeling posture but still seeing through Fenster's eyes.
The party sees him as frozen.
Fenster pressses on, making his way othrough the tunnel to a source of light that is orange.
The orb is aware of his presence and he freezes.
DB is trailing MC and sees something is wrong, motioning to Xanku.
Xanku investigates Morthos, finding him frozen and arched.
He whispers to him "Morthos, are you okay?"
Morthos makes no response.
DB gets an instinctive sense that something is wrong, something is amiss.
She sidles up to MC and is shocked by his rigidity.
MC feels clammy and corspelike.
TH yells out to DB "What's up?".
DB says "He's hung up again."
TH: "Shake him!"
Xanku pats MC down, he remains immobilized.
TH comes over and violently shakes MC, to no effect.
Meanwhile....
MC is vaguely aware of his body but he is seeing Fenster's sight still.
Within the room Fenster see's, the same ornage-purple fire burning.
The rooms appear to form the shape of a dragon, each room serving as an appendage of some sort.
MC intuits that the roooms/wings, and head/tail rooms each have a purpose.
There is some sense of greater purpose implied.
Silently, a piece of the wall behind DB slowly seperates itself from the surface, a strange stone toadlike creature.
As soon as she sees it, it strikes at her.

### DAY 20E (2022.01.07)

_Resuming combat with new creature in same initiative position._

MC: Confronts the new creature and ask if it is friend or foe?
The creature sends a nebulous neutral sensation to MC.
MC says "We do not want to fight you. May we pass in peace?"
The group receives a message from the entity, like a strong freefalling sensation, and the sense of aggresion dissipates.
We have exited combat!

_Successful Deescalation_

#### END COMBAT

DB casts Heal Wounds on TH for 12 HP.

We take a short rest and heal up the party with Hit Dice.
TH: 10HP (2d10)
DB: 12 HP (3d6)

We head back down the hallway and investigate the southern tunnel.
World mind bending nothingness in process.

We move to the Western room.
We cross the trap hole again.
MC: crosses no issue.
DB: crosses, barely (MC grabs her arm as she toes the ledge).
TH: Falls in punjabi hole.
XP: Falls in punjabi hole.
Both take 12 PIERCING DAMAGE.

As we enter the room, the eyes of the creature fall upon us and usupon it.
The creature is humanoid in form, but the mercurial surface appears to look like shaped liquid.
The party feels as if they are underground, jets of magma flowing around them, hugged tight in the hearted embrace of powerful earthen arms.

MC: May we enter?
Entity sends a sensation of even further squeezing to MC.

The group decides to leave the burial mound because we do not know what these things are or what they are doing here.
We return to the surface.

The fog that once covered the landside has disappeared.
As we exit, each member of the group recieves an intense revisiting of all three sensory experiences at the same time.
The intense sensations wash over the group, a letting of all knowledge exploding into our minds, a visceral knowing that shakes each member to their core.
Each experiences is individuated, too complex to simply explain, an existential epiphany that feels like a small eternity.
In reality it is but a few seconds, 15 or 20, but they time stretches into minutes, hours, days, timeless.

We discuss what to do next:

- Continue to our next quest?
- Investigate the story lines of The Dead Hand Society or The Veil.

DECISION: We ride to NeverWinter!

But first... we make a campsiote and sleep overnight to restore ourselves.
Camp is setup in the foot of the Mounds of Mystery, where the hills break the winds and hide the campfire.

Resume here next time with full reset!

---

### DAY 21 (2022.01.21)

We travel to NeverWinter, where we make our way through the heavilly packed streets twoards the House of a Thousand Faces.
Morthos, compelled by his ratism and thieves desires, is compelled to pickpocket a group of drunkled revellers, a man and two woman, heading presumably into a lascivious arrangement at some nearby inn.

MC gets:

- opalescent pendant with a figurehead carved into it - gold alloy chain, amulet.
- 10 GP
- Pinky Ring (white gold) with a dark blue stone set in the middle.

We make it to the House of a Thousand Faces and make our way to the bar.
The bartender recognizes us and offers to help us.
MC takes 3 rooms (for 8 GP per night - with breakfast anbd a dinner ale), but we will need to wait for about 15 minutes or so.
Xanku snakes seats by the hearth and we all sit down to wait.
The bartender is sending us drinks as well.
Thorune senses that someone may have been paying attention to oour conversation with the barkeep.
He feels them slipping out the door to leave.

TH tells the group he needs to check something out and follows the spy.
He makes his way calmly out the back door where the character left, then identifies the individual in the street.
Following them at a matched pace, he keeps them in sight.
They appear to be an affluent individual.
MC checks in over the sending stone link wih TH.
"I'm following the guy, he knows I'm following him."
He then gives us his general direction.
"Okay," MC says, "But if we don't hear from you soon we're coming to check on you."

TH begins to speedwalk and overtake the character.
Eventually he catches up with the hooded character and grabs them with both hands on the should, shoving them down on the ground.
As they turn to look up at him, he sees a bird-faced creature that is snapping and flapping to get free of him.
He pulls it to its feet, slaps it on th eface to regain its focus and addresses it.
"Why were you eaves dropping on my compatriats at the inn?"
It replies in frantic bird speak (gibberish to Thorune).
Thorune tells it to stop playing games and speak.

The bird creature begins to vocalize, gutteral primitive noises that become rough commmon tongue.
"I wasn't doing anything like that, why would you think I did that?" but clearly it is lying.
It is trying to find a way to talk without revealing anything.
Thorune takes out his sword hilt, places it across its throat, then threatens it.
The sword ignites.
"I don't like repeating myself..."
The creature nearly craps itself, making the symbol for the dead hand society briefly.
"Is that who hired you to watch us?"
It hangs its head in shame and struggles to croak out "Bloke".
"What is your name?"
It eventually clucks out "Dartek".
"Where can I find Bloke?"
He points towards the Hall of Justice.
"Tell Bloke, we will come see him when we are ready. In the meanwhile, leave us alone."
He tosses Dartek a Gold piece, which he catches and disappears into the crowd.

TH retuns to the Inn and rejoins the group.
He recounts his encounter to the group.
Xanku goes to the bar and asks the barkeep for the latest news.
"Do you have any work?"
"If you feel like getting your hands wet, there's a middle-level would-be mobster who has taken to exploit a few nearby orphanages and charity enterprises the Veil operates.
If you manage to talk a little sense into the fellow, stop this crap, there's 350 Gold pieces in it for you."

We decide to go to our rooms and rest for the night.
The barkeep meets us at the stairs abnd shows us up to three rooms in a row, each spacious and furnished nicely in a country style.
Each room also has an outward facing window.

DB takes the room at the end of the row.
TH takes the center room.
MC and XP share the first room.

MC reads XP dream journal, Rebecca.
"My feet hurt so bad, I hope I can rest while everyone is outside grilling. I should dream journal more often. The end."

MC casts Detect Magic but finds nothing remarkable about the Amulet or the pinky ring he stole.
We all go to bed.

After some time, TH begins to have a hellacious nightmare.
He feels pressure on his chest, knowing he is dreaming, but still feeling like he is suffocating.
The faces of his elders lok down on him, fading in and out of consciousness.
Unknown and known faces, even family, stare down at him.
He struggles to hold onto his life, existential dread taking him.
He is almost given over to asphyxiantion when he gasps deeply at last.
He is dreaming, but floating over a familiar settlement - his childhood village.
People are running around but there is no visible emergency.
He passes into consciousness, the faces of the elders peering down again, terrifying him until he wakesina panicked sweat.
After another 45 minutes or so he falls into an uneven sleep.

As the sun rises we all regroup in the main room for breakfast.
TH won't talk to the group about his dreams.
We talk to the barkeep (Orida) and ask where the areas to seek the problem guy?
MC asks what he goes by?
"He goes by Arua."
"And whereby might we find this Arua?"
"Just head East of here, a bit north, you'll know ti when you find it."

As we enter the neighborhood we see that it is halfway dilapidated and halfway abandoned.
There are some people straggling about, some in lines to receive blankets and soup as available.
Morthos asks one of the charitable workers if all is well today?
"I guess."
"We hear you have had some toruble with a fellow named Arua?"
Before they can answer, a man approaches us and addresses the group.
"I hear someone is looking for me? Arua?"

We turn to confront the man.
He claims to be guiding and operating the charitable operations.
We ask for proof that he is contributing or operating.
MC insults him: "What could a boy offer the Vail's operation?"
He get agitated but tries to regain his composure.
"I have nothing to prove."
MC says "Why shouldn't we just drag his ass back to the house of a thousand faces and collect our gold?"
At that threat he puffs up into a snake headed monster man, and we go into...

DB maintains the cloud of daggers on ARUA, stepping towards xanku, coming shoulder to shoulder and flanking him to widen their periphery of coverage. She fires SACRED FLAME at ARUA, hitting him for 11 FIRE DAMAGE. As his scales bubble, his torso writhes as though trying ot shed its skin. Arua rises up and slams his hands downward, a light blue-purple cloud rises from his feet a he slams something downward. There is a shadow being cast, but you can no longer see his body clearly.
MC sees sparks showering inside the smoke, like electrical discharge. MC casts FIRE BOLT straight ahead at the cloud, but the shot fires wide left, nearly hitting several street urchins that were observing the battle. DB screams at MC, "Watch it, Morthos!". MC leaps backward, flipping head over feet to land next to XP and DB.

Upon completing this battle, Thorune, DonnaBella and Morthos level up (LVL 7).
We will introduce our new abilities next time we meet up.

---

### DAY 22A (2022.02.19)

We wake and return to the main room, rested and levelled up from our adventuring.
The barkeep greets us and asks how our stay is going?
So far it is to our liking, better than the normal roadside inn.

He pays us fr the job: 350 GP in two sack that Morthos eighs briefly then accepts as good.
The barkeep wants to know who we killed.
Morthos relays the basic events, that a young man, nealry a boy approached us and engaged in battle.
He revealed himself to be a snake monster with human arms and we fought him to the death.
He summoned in two men with lizard heads, but they fled the battle before it ended as the tide turned against them.

Arlef, the bartender, makies a subtle eye gesture towards someone over Mortho's shoulder.
Morthos tries to follow it, but sees nothing.
"Who are you talking to?" he asks Arlef.
The crowd makes a hushed sound and all heads turn towards the landing, where Leyal stands.
She is elegant and regal in her robe, light glimmering in her white fur.
She approachesthe group and makes eye contact with each member of the party.

"We thank you for your accomplishment and deed, it should be celebrated, but this was but a small head of a much larger hydra."
She turns to Xanku.
"Did you notice anything, or sense anythign else?"
"The creature felt fiendish, as though a fiend were before us, I fear to say."
Leyal nodded reservedly.
"I was afraid of that. There are some who dwell within the sewars who traffic in a 'different' sort of traffic, an evil kiond of traffic. Things that slither and howl in the dark, but the urchins about the sewars report seeing it all the same. What we see upon the surface of the city, the political struggles, are but a polite facade of the deeper and darker struggles being fought below the surface. Arua and his klind thwart the efforts of our group in every quadrant, different players involved each time - shapeshifters, fiends,other faceless players who hide in the community."
She looks at Arlef and then back.
"Your battle yesterday was well met and of great value ot us."
Arlef nods in agreement. Leyal continues.
"If there is naything we cna do to assist you, or that you can do to benefit our group - especially sharing information - wuldf be of great help. There is far greater than 350 GP to be had, though the oposiotion outpaces us every day it seems. Our minds, resources and powers are stretched thin from constantly waging this battle."
TH asks "Who is the leader?
Leeal replies, "There is no leader, behind each one lies another. It is an endless chain."
TH asks "How do we stop them?"
Leyal replies "You do as you do, you stab. you slice. you chop. You continue as you are now."
"As you continuen your adventures or have any word from afar, your cooperation would be valued and rewarded. I can also help you in tutelage with alchemy and archery, beyond offering work opportunities. If you become interested, seek me out."
"How do we find you?" TH asks.
"This is always a good place to start, a front for what we think are our good deeds. I am my own Arua, if you will, but one aligned with the light."
MC asks "Where should we start then? If this is an endless regress of evil and monsters descending into darkness below us, how can we make an impact upon the surface world we are in? Do we simply go into the sewards and look for the hairy oomnsters and slithering creepy crawlies of a childs fears? Or is there somewhere more specifc we should go to seek out an advantageous beginning?"
Leyal projects a vision into the air beofre the group, a rapid series of images, our battles playing out all over the map, showing us that there is a confluence of energies in battle all around us.
"Go anywhere you like, climba mountain, seek the jungle. Regardless, you will find your sewar."
The image swerves to our manor, then reveals an artery that connects to the underground tunnels benetha our lands, zoomign out again to reveal a downward and upward linkage as well.
Light and dark swerve up and down across the linkages, revealing the artistry of an epic vision of the endless battle between good and evil.
"Well that's convenient," Xanku says.
Leyal leaves us to break our fast and consider our next moves.
We feast upon a delicious breakfast, though Xanku is disappointed by the lack of Crepes.
We consider our next moves carefully...

- The Rift

In the SouthEast of NeverWinter there is a bottoml;ess chasm, a rip in the ground so huge that the bottom lies unseen from all eyes above.
There are many stories and rumors from the hundred or two hundred years ago when this happened, the rift formation.
Neverwinter was not called Neverwinter then, but it was the same city.
A calamity befell the city, but it was so destabilizing that the truth was lost among the fragmented tribal legends opf the many peoples about the land.
There were other cataclysmic happenings at the same time, o Neverwinter (or whatever it was called then) was not unique in this way.

- The Sewars

The more nefarious sewars start at higher grounds and go deep.
The entrance near the large body of water in the NorthWest of the city is of specific interest to Leyal.

- Neverwinter Castle

The remains of the great keep... but what lies within?
Visitors are allowed in the historical site, secured for a good part of the structure.
However, it has many levels that go far deeper into the subterranean that most would dare go.

- Abandoned Shrine

On the far Eastside of Neverwinter the empty shrine sits.
Few attend it or leave tribute, but many say it is a known access point into the comings and goings on beneath the city.

- Ancient Cemetary

South side of Neverwinter lies a sprawling and ancient cemetary.

- Pre-rift Burial Mound

Nearby, just to the West of the Ancient Cemetary, lies an even older burial mound.

TH asks Leyal if she knows Mc Quaid. She nods her head yes.
TH asks if she knows other dragons?
She says she does know many, both small and large, like McQuaid.
Leyal (and Arlef) seem to be tied in, as are the rest of a House of a Thousand Faces.

We discuss the lay of the land and consider the many choices before us:

- The Lodge Mission
- The source cause of the disturbances in the East
- Underneath Bardcore Manor
- In Neverwinter:
  - The Rift
  - The Sewars
  - Neverwinter Castle
  - The Abandoned Shrine
  - The Ancient Cemetary
  - The Pre-rift Burial Mound

// RESUME HERE NEXT TIME!

### DAY 22B (2021.03.04)

We are at a nexus point, the group is now competent and capable but see that the picture is larger than we thought.
What is our focus now as a group?
Also as individuals, what are our objectives?
We share further backstory about our characters and our motivations that brought us here.
It is time to evolve our view of the characters journey.

- What do we want to become?
- What causes do we want to support?
- What scale of adventure do we want to aspire to? (dungeons, guilds, armies, kingdoms, worlds)

We decide to grease the wheels of the party by entering the sewars in the NorthWest by the lake.
Before we leave we acquire 3 lesser healing potions for 100 GP.

We begin to make our way up to the Lake in the NorthWest, the city seems normalbut it digresses intoa more slumish and worn state as we get further to the NE portion of the lake.

We come to a large manhole sized culvert grate.
TH lifts the lid off and peeers down, seeing liquid about 9 or 10 feet down.
There are rungs but they dont go all the way down.
MC gives one end of his rope to TH and carefully lowers into the hole.
He peeks carefully around and sees a piep running E to W.
About 60 feet in both directions MC sees small bits of light, at night it will be even darker.
He also sees a trickles of sewage runnign down a stonewalled trench in the floor.
Its lichenous and wet, plants growing all about in the dampness.
There are the sounds of rubble and rocks, sewar noises, but no meaningful sounds of life.
MC gives the group the all clear.

As the group begins to examine the sewars, we see the architecture of pipings and meeting points where smaller grates are set. These could be other ways of venting air from below.

We roll for perception (all pass but MC), adn those that do are reminded opf the tunnels where we met McQuaid beneath Bardcore manner, alien in nature, giving everyone a slight unease.

We decide to head Eastward, though we must travel single file.
TH takes the lead to use his light sword to generate illumination (15 ft bright, 15 normal light, plus bous action to brighten).
He starts full brightness... the group recoils from the intense light and TH dims it.
Single file order: TH, DB, MC, XP

As we journey forward we hear small sounds that could be footfalls.
MC summons Fenster (as a black cat) and manifests him ahead of the group.
Fenster heads forward to walk point.
He approaches the first edge of the light, and percieves rats and older cat smells.
A small group of rats scuttle into the dark, but in teh distance a half clothed humanoid is visible.
There are at least 2 of them, walking in front of the rats.
They seem oblivious to the rats or Fenster as they trudge on.
MC sends Fenster to see if he can get close enough to identify what the creatures are.
Fenster catches up to them and they appear to be goblin like.
They seem to be arguing and talking.
TH dims his sword.
MC casts Comprehend Languages and listens in.

G1 is complaining that Pmac just wants to get fatter while we work harder.
G2 says he is happy to have a job and feed his family.

We trail them with Febnster before us, but MC cant see so he grabs DBs shoulder.
She tries to shake him off and MC splashes against the wall.
TH turns to tell them to be quiet and scrapes his breastplace against the wall.
The two goblins turn to the sound and see Fenster.
They can tell someone is there and assume a defensive posture.

MC lets go of Fenster and approaches the two carefully.
"Greetings friends."
"What do you want?" they ask.
[a dialog ensus about pmac, who is the boss, at the rocks, who gives work, to dig up the rocks, for holding up the dirt, for pmac]
We ask if we can meet pmac and they agree to let us accompany them.

The group walks along with them and on through more complex tunnel systems.
Pipes nd creatures fill the space in intricate pattersn, creatures scurrying away from the passers by or hiding deflty. Eventually we reach a larger area where there are several workers digging stones up from the ground and moving them. The workers are a mix of goblins, bugbears, and other creatures.
The goblins point at a large bugbear in the center, indicating that is Pmac.
"Thanks fellas, have a good day." MC says.
We approach Pmac who asks us tersely "What do you want at my worksite?"

He explains that they are busy trying to repair a large openining the culvert, patching a wall with bricks.
"Everything come through there through these types of walls. We patch the holes to protect from intrusion. City of NW maintenance crew."
A large open section beyond remains to be filled in.
MC asks how many of these there are?
BB: "They are all over. We have a workload every day. Can I help you, because I really need to get on with my work. I have 11 hours to complete this wall or esle its my ass."
MC: "Thank you, we will be on our way."

The party enters the cavern they are sealing, wondering if we will return in 11 hours, or at all.
The space before us begins to open up, inky darkness filling the space, the floor dropping into abyssal space.
TH raises his sword "Oh great," he says and fires up max brightness.
The light falls away in fog and blackness, dust moving across the face of the chasm.
We come to a blocked passageway, with a mostly closed opening.
MC sends Fenster through as a bat to check it out.
Anopther room lies beyond, more cavernlim but still roughly a large bowl.
Fenster detects movement in the far side and and investigates.
MC loses connection suddenly as Fenster is snuffed out of existence by somethign unseen.

We debate what to do, shoot fire, drop in or what?
DB uses a ring she acquired and casts Faery Fire on the spot the movement was seen.
SHe creates a cube of violet light that illuminates the area.
A strange creature with fallpy wing and a humanoid arms and head with a long tail begins flitting about moving like a giant bat, erratically.
MC summons Fenster again and manifests him as an owl.
Black and purple creature wth taught skin and leathery wings, huge fangs in its lower jar and long pointed ears with antelope like horns.
The creature rushes Fenster, blowing through him, and charging the group.
It passes through Morthos as though he is ephemeral, flying up behind the group.
The workers flee in utter panic, chaotically tripping over themselves to escape the threat.

##### END BATTLE

We will investigate the aftermath of the battle next time.

DB and XP heal each other. (DB = 12, XP = 4)
We turn to explore the space.
MC sends Fenster on a fly-about as a bat, but he sees very little in the extreme darkness.
We are still blind in the general lay of the land.
TH lights up his sword and we look around, but see no end to the floor.
XP fires a fire arrow into the distance, it goes a good 500 feet before it descends into darkness after flying over waves of uneven terrain and floor.
XP tries to walk over the edge and slips, sliding down about 15 feet into the depression before stopping.
He cautiously looks about, perceiving something flowing but with a sizzling aspect (perhaps magma). Wind is audible, moans and whispers peeking out from within the depths.
XP tells everyone what he sees.
MC, DB and TH follow him to the ground.
Upon landing next to XP we all begin to feel a warped sense of reality, not necessarilly magic like we practice it, but something other wordly.
We decide to press forward and see if we can pass through it.
TH takes point, XP followin on right flank, DB behind him watching left flank, MC in the rear guard.
The columns of stalagtites tower further and further above us, the ground growing rockier and more uneven.
It does not feel like a chamber, but more as if the space is opening further into a great hall.
Space still feels distorted, the wall behind us where we entered feeling farther than we have travelled.
TH's light (15 bright + 15 dim) provides enough light for the group to see, but the earth slopes away endlessly despite the ups and downs of out croppings..
TH feels his normal focus waning, blurred and depleted.
MC has the sudden sensation of cold, starting at his achilles and rising up his spine. He almost takes a knee, struggling to rise and the cold feeling surges again.
MC catches himself on a rock and stumbles forward, the cold receding.
He calls out to DB "What causes feebleness and cold?"
DB says "the cild and the ray of enfeeblement curse, but I dont know much Are you okay?"
MC "Yes, but XP - switch with me."
MC moves to the left flank, DB to the right flank, XP takes up the rear.
TH notices the rock underfoot becoming smoother.
TH begins to feel oddly elated and uncaring, he begins to scream "Baby Ruth! Echo!" into the darkness around him.
The sound of thousands of leathery wings flap into life, filling the darkness above as an undercurrent of ghoulish voices chatter in the darkness.
MC casts Detect Magic, but sees nothing within teh 30 feet of its range.
We continue to move forward as TH ask the group to sing with him "about the golden road".
DB and XP hear the wings and sound of voices, but are not effected in other ways.
As we approach the edge of a deep dark drop off, DB slaps MC and warns him that TH is about to walk off a cliff.
MC grabs his hand and asks him to stop.
th says we need to contiue to the cabin in teh center, where the man is.
He steps forward, about to step off the cliff.
MC grabs him by the breast plate and pulls, but TH is to sstrong, continuing to ease forward towards the darkness below.
"A little helpe here!" MC calls out.
DB runs forward and grabs TH as well, the added strength enough to pull him back from the edge.
XP ties a rope to a boulder and dexterously wraps the length about TH as we hold him.
MC knocks TH down at the knees, XP pulling him back so he falls away from the chasm.
The disturbance arises a creature that floats into view, a tentacled undulating beast with clacking beack and odd brainlike head.
