### DAY 14C (2021.03.13)

We resume having just fininshed getting our tattoos.

As Xanku comes out of the Inn to join the party, the White Dragon comes soaring across the sky, terrifying the towns people and sending children scattering for cover.

The dragon banks through the sky, assumedly looking over the pasture lands nearby to the North-West near the orchards for cattle. As he turns he may swoop back towards town but it appears safe for now, although the beats is circling the town in general.

We take cover around the Lion's shield, watching the dragon circle back and fire a white blast at three sheep in the pasture. A few surviving sheep begin to flee as the dragon banks south.

The party continues to hunker down as the dragon cranes his head back and forward. He comes back to the spot he blasted the sheep to the west of twon and beins to cautiously descend towards the site of the attack. He slowly descends, his wings batting away a frosty mist taht disappate in the morning breeze, all that remians is the frozen mist emanating from the ground and sheep corpses.

Morthos sneaks up to the broken remains of a stone wall on teh west of town to observe the dragons behavior.

Donabella moves to the western side of the Lion's Crown.

Xanku moves to the wagon train, observing from behind the safety of the caravan.

Thorune moves to the western edge of the building west of the Lions Crown.

The reports we have heard are of the dragon accositng animals and maybe Orcs, but we do not know what else it may have intentions of consuming.

We wait to see what he does.

As the dragon approaches the sheep it hit, it surveys them, calculating where the others may have fled as well as paying attention to the nearby town. It grabs one up in his mouth and consumes one cleanly, nothing going to waste. The sheep appears to be frozen, like a banana. The dragon gathers the remaining sheep up toward himself, waddling along and dragging itself on the ground.
It is searching the surroundings, cautious but notnecessarilly making any movements towards us or acknowledging our presence.

Donnabella attempts to identify the gender. She knwos it is a whitedrafgon, which are considered inferior intellectually to other dragons. She can't tell the dragons sex, but she knows it is hunting. The posture is not just hunting, but also like it is scouting. It is over 80 feet in length, if not more. It appears (from this side) to be unwounded or injured.

It has taken the other sheep in its claws and is waddling like a duck around, investigating. The hands are connected to the wing webbings, headed north-west towards the remaining sheep herd. It walks like a Mystic from Dark Crystal, staying low to the ground and swishing back and forward.

We wait it out.

The dragon waddles unhurredly away, following the sheeps trail but seems to give up on tracking them and prepares to take to the sky. It looks back south towards the town, then begins to lift off the ground. It shrieks and exhales as it lifts into the air, but hovers straight up, its tail dragging on the ground.

He gains advantage and we roll for stealth.

Donnabella rolls 8, and is seen.
The dragon sites her movement and begins to slowly move in teh direction of the Lion's Shield.
She dives under the proch and into the Lion's Shiled to hide.
Morthos rolls 19 and remoans hidden, but the dragon heads south after seeing donabell.
Morthos rolls 11 and hides in a nearby bush.
Xanku rolls 11 and hides under the wagon.
Thorune darts across the town towards the West, drawing the dragons attention away from town.
The dragon ands in the path of Thorune on a nearbu hilltop, watching.
It looks defensively offensive, but it is waiting.
Thorune stops and raises his hands in a gesture of non confrontation.
The dragon continues watching.
Thorune rolls a perception check (9)

Thorune asks in draconic " Do you understand what im saying?"
The dragon replies in draconic "I know what you are saying,"
Then in common says "but I do not know what youre doing..."

Thorune "I just want to see what you want here magnificent white dragon?"
Dragon "Ive seen you and Ive seen your friends. I take it those were not just cosmetic tattoos you got. What are you trying to prepare for?"
TH: "We are adventurers and we are tryin gto protect ourselves."
DR: "from what?"
TH: "Evil doers..."
DR: _snorts_ "You talk of evil?"
TH: "How do you knwo fo our tattoos"
DR: _snort_
TH: "We ar etrying to set plates for the table..."
MC stands up.
DR sniffs the air.
MC persuasuion check (13)
MC: "Oh great dragon, we seek only to protect these innocent people and understand your intentions."
DR paces back and foprward...
DR: "Are yo beholden to these poeple?"
MC: "We have been sent here to protect these people. SO we are beholden in that sense."
DR: "WHo sent you?"
MC: "Eidrich Tanthos..."
DR: does not like mention ofthat name, but seems to accept that we are in over our heads.
MC: "We hold no allegience to Eidrich Tanthos, we are advneturers from abroad who have come here to protect the realm. If you can give us reason why we should not trust Eidrich Tanthos, we will entertain that knowledge."
DR seems to consider this... he is employing analysis and strategy.
DR: "First of all, I know there is at leats four of you. WHere are the others? Are we parlaying or are you distracting me?"
DB scrambles out from under the porch and stands cautiousy visible.
XP crawls out and echoes MC "We are trying to help thes epoeple and have o intention of harming anyone, we are just here for a job. We would like to avoid bloodshed if possible."
MC: "This is our party, we mean you no harm."
DR puffs up and examines the area, verifying that we are being honest.
TH: "I am Avasandius Thorune, what may we call you?"
DR: "I have not decided that you _may_ call me yet... I dont knwo w=how mcuyh you know about teh poeple who sent you here, but have you talked to anyone that said Ive harmed anyone?"
MC: "No great drasgon, we have no word of you being violent."
DR: "It is true, I have come and taken tribute, but I have no interest in harming people. If it is true what you say of your bossess... (he stumbles on the word boss - using chieftan, captain, older words that are more ancient). If your job is to protect these people from evil doers or those doimngharm, then I have no quarrel wioth you.. BUT if it is as I assumed it is, then your job is to remove me and my kind, perhaps you do not know it."
MC: "We were assembled and hired, but we do not know Edirich Tanthos well and have our own reaons to be suspicious of him. If you coudl enlighten us of reaons to be ary and better informed so that we are not on the wrong side of the quarrel,we woudl be glad to hear of it."
DR: "Tanthos is a man of many faces, Tanthos represents people and powers who are interested in dominance/expansion - clearing out what lies in their way of power and lands... I do not knwo the nature of your rlationship wit these poeple, but they are a threat to what was here first."
DR: "What is it you think the true nature of your mission is here?"
MC: "We have felt we were deceived by those who sent us, but we have tried to help the mining camp and the dwarves in the mines and the gnomes. But we have encountered were jackals and orcs and fought them. We are just tryngto protect he good people of the land and protect what sacred sites are here."
DR scratches a sybmol (triangle with the eye in it) and asks us what it means to us?
DB tells us the whats what and whos who of the groups we interacted with because MC and TH could not remember.
MC: We have been helped by teh people of the Vale, who helped us.
DR: "This is the hand that grabs (The Dead Hand Society)"
MC: We have met Lady Lemiur who told us we must stop the DHS and directed us to the House of a 1000 Faces, but we do not know what the bigger game is.
DR: I have seen the march of power over the centuries, taking control of lands and resources. Let us part with this...
You spoke of orcs and goblins earlier, some of the havok in this region (and abroad) has happened because of me, it is true, but that is because of displaced power structures. I have coe here to establish myself, but I do not want to take from the people such as this town anythig what is due to a creature of my stature."
MC: Could we establish a regular tribute to you that would protect the town? Is there something we can do to prove ourselves honest to you?
DR: A tribute is step one, your behavior going forward will determine my trust of you. Talk to the people of Fandolin. I have your scent, I know how to find you. As for the other low creatures, orcs and goblins, in my nearby homestead I do my part to stem the tide of their wrath but I can also see patterns of movement. Shoudl tis relationship prove fruitful I can provide information to you, if I so choose.
XP: Do you have kin here, others like yuo, or is that too presumptuous of us to ask?
DR: There are others nearby, but for now I am alone.
MC: "Is there a name we can address you by, you are clearly to intellifgent to be called simply beast. How may we respectfully address you?
DR: "I have not had to concern myself with this in many moons. How to call me or what to call me..."
TH: "I offer you a sending stone to communicate."
DR: Looks at the stone, knowingly. "Perhaps another time, but for now," he points to Trascendor Manor, "I've seen recent activity over there. Perhaps you can erect something there to light."
MC: "We are managing Trascendor, we could place a large brazier and light it when we need your advice."
DR: "If that is indeed your house, I advise closing the tunnel underneath it."
MC: The one with the spiders?
DR: "I know of other creatures that are there..."
MC: Bigger than spiders?
DR: :Bigerrrrrr."
XP: How can we assist you should you need help?
DR: I appreciate the offer, perhaps another day...
With that he flies away, circling the town and disappearing into teh clouds, his direction unknown.
He is a Lone Wolf - McQuaid!!!
XP: "I want to be like the dragon when I grow up..."

We clean our shorts and return to the task at hand.
XP gets some tatts.
MC updates the coffers too subtract the cost of the tattoos.

### DAY 14D (2021.03.27)

Resuming... town is still in shock.
No one has appeared, still ghosted.
We head to mis estables to collect Eona and our cart and buggy.
From there we head over to Trisandor manor, aka Bardcore Manor.
There are workers fixing the holes in the ground floor and repairing the roof for us.
We explore the rest of the manors ground floor.
We find an old office and scullery, both in moderate functional status.
We find servants quarters and stairs to the second floor.
On the second floor we find rooms that have been exposed to the elements for years.
Everything is very shabby in the house, broken and worn or straight ruined.
We will have to repair or replace everything.

We return to the stables to acquire more horses.
They have two nags, one looks good and one looks acceptable.
They buy both for 15 Gold.

Lost in revelry about memories of his clan.
The sorrow of his departure and the reasons for it as well as resatoring the pride of his people, feeling on the poath to winning honor arriving soon.
During this, three yipping trinket dangling creatures flank Thorune in the darkness.
They are reminiscent of a wereJackal, but are Gnolls.
They are tibal, wearing bone jewelry and leather garb ina tribal mamnner.

### DAY 15A (2021.04.10)

We resume our journey by tending to our horses and follow the neverwinter trail.
Eyes are upon the party as we journey near the woods.
We feel their retched intentions from the forest's edge.
As we pass the woods, no major threats reveal themselves to the party.
We snack along the jounrney, sacrificing rests for distance.
In the late afternoon, we begin to see something resembling civilization.
Some miles in teh distance lies an old community named Coneyberry.
The road forlks West in Coneyberry, the other forks through town into the Neverwionter Woods lurking to the North.
The town, once nice, is now in decay and disrepair.
Its inhabitance stay hidden, no sign of obvious life to be seen.
As we slow approaching, somethign resembling a horse begins to approach.
It runs as if it were being lead by a rider, but as it approaches we see that it is a centaur.
He pulls up within sight, posture indicating greeting but with a question.
Morthos raises his hand in hailed greeting, then drops it.
The horse kicks and the rider stands tall and proud.
Basic contact made, initial prospects positive.
The centaur appears to be alone.
He has somethign slung across his chest, could be a bandolier.
Something lies beyhind him, unbrandished but ready to reach.
It could be a quiver for a bow.
He is on upperground north of us, about 20 feet above us.
The horses are not afraid, but recognize teh energy of another equine presence, respect of the herd.
Xanthu says "Hot Day, eh?"
Centaur says (in Common): "What ho adventurers, how does your travel find you today?"
Morthos: "We are making ur way NoprthEast to Butterskull Ranch to check on some people. How are you?"
Centaur: "Asks if we have info about, and shares that there have been a lot of creatures pushing westward down the trail. Where have we come from, have we noticed anything?"
MC: "we have seen nothign but have felt eyes upon us all day?"
C: "Things are not normalk, ou of their locations and behavoral patterns, not just small things - larger dangerous creatures.
XP: "Have you encountered any, is that your business?"
CE: "I have, orc, but survived. I encountered owlbearwolf but avoided confrontation."
MC: "Is it common to encounter gnolls in this part of the country?"
CE: He has heard there are lycanthropes about, but they are not common per say. In the badlands west and these woods, all manner of creatures trhiev. The coast limits mch of the dark from spreading, but they are eiotehr being riskier or... something is pushing them out.MC: What do you know about dragins in this area?
The centauir man rears.... and calms again.
CE: "I have seen from the skya greaty white silvery beast, years since I had seen another dragon, word from other travellers was that they had close encounters."
MC: "Have you had any direct problem with the beast?"
CE: "No, but its abeast and - he too eats of flesh."
MC: "We believe the dragon is safe at this time, he has no hostile intent so lon as he is fed."
CE: He comes towards us, to within 300 feet now and approaching. "Friends, there is no way you spoke to a dragon."
MC: "I assure you fair steed, we spoke at length eith teh dragon. We thought it a plain white dragoni, but it spoke in draconic and common. It is true."
CE: bristles a bit at good steed remark, asks Rune for details.
TH: I spoke in draconic, it answered in common.
CE: "What might I do to help you?"
MC: "We dont know whats going on, never been to Butterskull before. Went dark."
CE: There are monsters up there. Assumed you were another group looking for teh treasure so teh shrine of Savras. Lost treasures from town of coneyberry (sacked and wealth robbed) stached enar the shrine.
CE: Thanks for the exchange _clops away_
DB: Write sin her journal, documenting.

```
We see coneyberry approaching, 2 miles away in the distance.
```

XP: Peception Check for traffic on the roads.

You see less signns of traffic, hard to see anythign recent per say.

We approach the town at a normal pace, singler file:

- Morthos on horseback.
- Xanku on wagon.
- Thorune on horse with DonnaBella on pillion.

Entering town we see much damage, a small bridge enbtering teh dark wood of NW beyond, opening into the small town of twenty or so small buildings.
No other signs of movement, humanoid anyway, we enter slowly.
XP feels like he almost saw something, at eye level down the road across the bridge towards the woods, but as quickly as he looked at the reddish smear, it blinked out of existence.
Total silence. Total stillness.
Nothing else responds.
We decide to head West and ignore the sighting.
The stables and pig pens border our exit as we turn west onto the Tryboard trail.
It flattens as it turns towards Phandolin.
About 2 miles outside of town, XP sees a lone domesticated cow close to the trail.
MC comes right up to the cow, alerting it to our presence.
The cow is calm and allows our close approach.
She is brownish and white, has a bell collar on.
Brand on back left hip that is a "BR".
Looks a little hungry or thirsty but otherwise healthy.
We feed it an apple and lash it to the cart via loose lead.
As we make our way up teh trail, we see a ranch property tucked between som low lying hills.
We follow a trail thet cuts off teh Tryboar and heads directly to the ranchhouse.
There is a signifiganrt fire smouldering on the back of the property.
It looks like it is not active anymore.
The fence approaches on our left, soon to give way to the property.
We see evidence of some bodies in the field.
Morthos rides over to investigate.
It is the gutted remains of several humans, maybe rasnch hands.
Also the remains of several large grey-green orcs (6-7 foot).
MC examines the bodies (rolls 20 on perception check).
They have been cleaved, chest to hip, down spine, dressed in ragged hide armor. Shattered club and bone staff weapomns litter the corpses. Primitive jewelry is all they wear.
MC examines the human bodies.
One is head crushed in, bludgeoned in.
Other is ripped and sliced with thousands of cuts on back and shoulders.
We approach the house, within a few hundred feet.
MC rides up to scout closer, XP covers.
Cornfields block the north and east, an orchard flourishing in the north west.
MC proceeds ahead, the path forking with a small pond beyond.
To the north west lies a burning structure ruins remain, perhaps abarn.
To the north east lies more corn.
MC finds three more bodies along the way, close together and killed en masse.
They are bludgeoned and lacerated.
A burbned out smithy coems intoi view across the pnd, smouldering ashes crying smoke.
TH circumvents the orchard to approach the farmhouse remains from the west edge.
To the west lies more corn.
Morthos creeps up alongside the pond.
XP creeps into the brungin barn remains to investigate.
Perception check (rolls 3).
Donnabella rolls and sees nothign either.
Morthis rolls a check (18) and sees evidence of foot traffic around the brn and teh smithy.
Also sees patterns of orcish feet going towards the farmhouse.
From a distance, hears commotion from the farmhouse.
Morthos moves close to the smouldering smithy ruins.
Sees nothign outsiode the farmhouse, but movement in windows.
Morthos dismounts, leaving teh horse loose, and stealths up to the house and investigates.
He hears orcs inside racously partying.
Donnabella gets off and loosely ties her horse to a rail, then moves closer.
XP moves up to pond and sets up watch.
TH brings up rear.
MC sees a cellar door midway down teh wall, other windows appear toi be draw but askew.
MC sneaks up to the door and puts his ear against it to listen.
Doesnt hear anything.
Opens the cellar door without making any sound.
Props it open and steps within, using darkvision.
It is inky black, but has dirt floor but larger basement size.

Its a sizable room with support columns in the middle.
In the center of the space is a seated caracter with a hood over their head.
MC stealthhs up to seated character.
ACross wall behind him is series of waxen yellow skulls.
A giant humanoid creature ius sitting there.
Feint writhing of chest, head slumped, hands tied to behind chair.
MC: Pssst! You alive?
Figure panics.
MC: "Sit still, be quiet."
Beaten to hell, terrified but not leaving.
"Im big al, my ranch, Hhoep you brought an armuy."
MC: "Come with mem, heal you outside."
MC helps him free and he stumbles out behind Morthos.
They try to sneal back to DonnaBella we both make poor rolls.
The orcs heasr us but dont find us, we freeze until they stop looking.
Things are on alert now.
MC and Al reach DB.
MC: "Heal him if you can."
DB: "Is he worth it?"
MC: "Are you?
Al: "..."
MC: "Never mind. WHat happened here?"
Al: "They came in like they owned the place, filled with blood lust. Dunno why I am still alive."
MC - sneak s back to window and casts comprehend languages.
Multiple orc voices, party banter, sounds like 5 or 6.
Stupid humans food is crap, but beer is good.
Move back to Al and DB.
MC: "Al, is anyone left alive here?"
Al: "I saw two of my men fall. Maybe 3."
MC: "We saw 5 coming in. How many total?"
Al: "Maybe nine total."
MC: "Whats left to salvage here? Kill the orcs?"
AL: "The house... ALl I have left."

Plan:

- Morthos and Xanku flank path below porch to lure out orcs.
- Morthos knocks on door with Mage Hand.
- Xanku soots first orc to open door with arrow.
- As remainders pour out, DonnaBella casts Cloud of Dagges on them.
- Morthos and Xanku take adbvantage of carnage.
- Thorune waits in hiding for reserve attack.

Inventory stuff spreadhseet for next week!

### DAY 17A (2021.06.04)

We regroup and sort inventory, selling off ALL the things.
We are ready to journey!
We choose the Axeholm adventure.

It takes us 5 hours to reach Axeholm.
We find an intimimdating stone work structure protruding from the mountain side.
The iron portcillus blocks us.
There are arrow slots all around but no one appears home.
They are like a small window.
Entry path to the portcillus is a stone flanked tunnel, lined with arrow slots and armed projectiles pointing out (ballistas).
Inside the gate appears to be several more sections of ballista lined walls for 35 feet or so.
At the end are a pair of grand closed doors.

Morthos uses pitions and climbs the outer wall to an arrow slot to look inside.
It appears quiet and empty inside.
MC wiggles his way into the space beyond after some effort.
Inside he finds an small room, but down the hall he sees a giant spider.
MC decides to slither back out while undetected.
He repeats the action on the other side, climbing the wall on pitons.
Inside he finds a mirror room , with a giant spider odwn the hall.
He exits again.
Outside TH and MC stand clear as MC uses Magehand to trigger all the ballistas in front of the portcillus
Repeats the same for the first tw inside.

MC, TH and XP manage to lift the portcillus to knee high.
DB suggest we shore it up wiuth a boulder.
We find a large one and jam it against the wall and the gate.

Donnabella sneaks through the ballista opening and finds stairs up to the spiders and a rusted lever she cannot budge, presumably for the portcillus.

She comes back out and we all sneak under the portcillus.
MC triggers the remainign ballisrtas, one opens a hole in the wall we can all enter though.

Inside the structure we find more ballistas.
MC sets the safety on all the ballistas.
We quietlky open the door at the foot of the stairs, avoiding the spiders above.

---

### DAY 17B (2021.06.19)

We decide to enter the room closest to the front of the fort and outside wall.
Morthos picks the lock, barely, but breaks it in doing so.
Upon entering it is a ransacked room full of cheap odds and ends.
It seems to small and modest to be the home for a secret treasure.
It is four solid walls, no windows or enrtances, but large enough to rest.

We make camp and have a short rest, healing.
MC uses 3d8 for 14, back up to 52.
XO uses 1d10 for 10, back up to max.
TH uses 2d? for 14, back up to ???
DB is full health.

Afterwards we examine the ghoul corpses.
The corpses are dwarven in feature, short of stature and armoured.
Half male, half female.
They may have once been some kind of guard.
They have some used weapons and items, but nothing of real value.

We decide to explore the rooms sequenctially from the outside inward.
MC opens the first door around the inner corner and reveals a large hall.
It has two pillars to the ceiling that border a giant smokestack chimney.
MC creeps stealthilly around the outer edge of the room, watching the chimney.
MC finds nothing aside from a decrepit room.
There are many broken bunk beds and foot lockers.
We search the room, bunks, lockers, beds, tables and find...

- parchment papers, unfinished letters.
- 7 SP, a few coppers

We move on to the next door.
MC does the listen and stealth open check.
This room sounds dead silent.
MC opens the door and finid within Dwarf toilets!
MC checks the stalls and room, glancing in the toilets.
In the second hall, fingers are reaching out of the toilet hole.
MC stabs it and kills it.
There is nothign else.

We move on to the next door, leading deeper into the fort.
MC listens to the door, and almost misses a small buzz that changes tone and stops.
Something is on the other side of the door, a reedy paper sound.

Morthos listens to the double doors and hears nothing.
The group decides to enter the room with the noise.

As MC opens the door, he sees movement in the far right corner.
The sound of leathery slapping is louder.
There are anvils and a smithy, several fire places with blacksmithing use.
In the back right corner we see three winged meaty creatures.
They immediately fly up the chimney in the corner.

We search the room, and find a small assortment of metals for smithing.
MC puts them into a puch and tossesthem into the bag of holding.
It is about 5lb and worth about a gold piece.

In the back of the smithy room is a single door.
MC listens but hears nothing.
We deside to reurn to the final double doors we passed earlier.

These lead into the center of the entrance and a great giant hall.
There are four pillars holding up the tall roof.
MC enters quielty and skirts the outer wall, lookimng for traps or threats.

The forty foot ceilings droop above us, dusty and dank ruins tat once were of great beauty and awe.
MC sees arrow slits perched about 20 feet up on the walls, facing into the north and south walls of the room, similar to the ones from the outside.
MC sees a flicker of possible movement in the northern side slits.
MC tries to investugate the northern gate out, but trips as he walks.
The motion triggers skittering movements in teh darkness.
Something wet hits the walls above.
As XP and TH enter the room, we engage in combat.

### DAY 17C (2021.XX.XX)

Eagle Night Beiber Dragon!!!

We resume the moment of suspense...

MC casts his spell upon the stone and gazes deeply into its source.
It is of a magicla nature, can be worn, can be used to help the wearer to stablize on deaths door (from 0 to 1 HP without using your savings throw - automatic).
This Jewel goes into the periapt of wound closure.
When you choose to use your hit dice, it will double your hitpoints gained once per day.
This is justthe jewel, but you can put it into the full pendant housing.

We take have ssured the room and take our long rest.
DB takes the first watch...
As MC is in sleep, while fading, he has the sensation of being unnerved...
.. a creeping sense of darkness closes in around the party, a sense of anxiety growing.
... you sense you are missing something, as though you are missing something or you need to get something.
You find yourself loooking around...

WATCH 1: DB

MC rolls a perception check to investigate the room, but rolls a natural 1, falling over in the darkness.
... he passes out, embarrassed, and uncomfortable with his sense of dread.
TH rest deeply and rejuvenates, but arises from the mists of sleep, like a waking dream.
... you ARE dreaming, a repeat of being with your clan, a sense of helplessness - a night terror,
... reflecting a period in his life where both he and the clan perceived him as a risk from his newly developing powers.
... you yearn to reach out to your clan and let them know you are well, buth youa re ocked in a repeating cycle of
... feeling your weaponized powers grow and your fear of losign control and hurting those around you.
... you sleep fitfully afterwards, no longer resting deeply but in a troubled state.
XP begins to revisit the drk memories of his lost past, questioning his purpose and role in life... feeling broken...
DB revisits her past as she watches oevr the group, remembering her childhood on the streets, surviing alone
... her independance drives her, a quest for knowledge or somethig moreto empower herself.
... she feels disarmed, laid bare that she realizes she does in fact need something,
... whether her place int eh world or her own group.
... She shakes from her reflections and wakes XP for his turn of watch.

WATCH 2: XP

Further ruminations on dark broodings.... but no events...
Wake up TH eventually.

WATCH 3: TH

TH wakes quickly from sleep, putting on his mental armor.
XP goes to rest in the corner.
TH watches for an hour or two, troubled by the battered internal winds of the fortress.
... the sound is unsettling, something must explain it, but it is unnerving
... until SUDDENLY:

A white hot screech tears through the silence, actively ripping the silence into terrifying vibrations.
It is pained and anguished, but not loud enough to wake the sleeping party.
TH wakes Morthos.
He tells MC of the sound.
MC focuses quickly, dropping to the floor and pressing his ear to the floor, listening intently.
He hears something deeper behind the screeching, something breathing.
MC sits in lotus positoin and stills his mind, going deaf and blind as he casts find familiar.
... summonign a rat, he crawls under the door and down the hall, heading back towards rthet dwarven forge.
... He crawls under the unopened door and finds a bathroom,
... the scent of dwarven waste filling his nostrils.
... there is a crack he can see thrugh. but he cannot get in without digging at it.
... he heads back up to the double dorrs in the hall outside the camsite room and enters the throne room.
... he husg the walls, scenting teh corpses opf the giant spiders
... he gets to the double doors in the room but cannot open them.
... he listens but hears nothing som continues along
... as he rounds the last corner he catches movement, maybe from the arrow slits
... that the spiders crawled throughg (28 feet up),
... pauses uncertain and continues to the other double dorrs.
... the space beyind these doors sounds larger to his ears, and there is a sense of faint movement behind teh door.
... he continues around the room and enters the ballista holes the spiders were behind earlier in the hallway.
... he sees the rows of ballistas and the dead spiders on the floor.
... the mechanism to open the portcullis is visible on the wall to the north.
... he enters the ballista holes on the eastern side of the room.
... there is a tunnel carved into the wall leading away...
... an enormous chilling shriek bursts out of the dark again,
... he sense sthat it is up in the center of the fortres sif it is localized
... he continues ot explore the range he can see, the tunnel curves away into the wall of stone into the bedrock of the mountain
... he crawls up teh staiors and sees another large area, rooms filled with large and small columns.
... the room is around 20 foot, the columns giving way to a hearth abd a cauldron.
... this is the area where when we walked under murderholes this is the room they were likley in
... there is evidence of more giant spiders, webs and corpse sacks, etc.
... he crosses the room to the other staiorwell going down, revealing more herths, spider habitations ,etc.

[hp 35/53] TH: Raises his Lightning Sword and ignites the blade, hitting her for 14 DMG (10 + 2 + 2). The Banshee screams and burns up like flashpaper, disappearing into nothing.

[hp 32/32] XP: "Woohooooo!!!"

[hp 26/XX] DG: DEAD

##### END BATTLE

We examine the area and the DG's body, but we find nothing but a tattered, gooey epilette.

Note: Had we not survived the intial ST on the BNSH, we would have all died immediately.
Note: BNSH resistance acid, fire, lightning thunder.
Immune to cold, necrotoic and poison.
Resistant to blungeoning, piercing and slashing.

MC: "We shuld clear these last three rooms and make camp for the night, we need rest."

The party moves into the middle room on the southern side of the corridor.
The rotting furniture of teh castle remains, though obviously once fine, with a note :
"Valis, your directive is clear and remaians a top priority.
Should you require help, contact the local vice regent.
Yours in brotherhood.
[Symbol of Eye in Pyramid with three Dots around it]
(The Veil)"

The BNSH may have been Valis... we will shall have to investigate.

In the room to the East there is a room with a tub, filled with gnawed on Dwarven bones.
The tub is filled and has a plug that blocks the bottom of the basin.
There is a water spigot thta might have once provided water.

In the back room to the West, we explore. XP and TH (rolling 19 & 18) discover secrets.
There is a large stone bed and a stained fireplace.
The fireplace ion the back wall appears to have humanoid handprints on it.
XP approaches the fireplace wall and places his hand on the wall, pushing gently.
A panel slides aside and reveals a hidden room.

Inside is achest with a built in lock, standing atop iron clawed feet.
It does not have a key hole, it has an imprint shpaed like an anvil and ...
TH uses the signet ring to unklock the large iron chest.

Within the chest we find:

- Large Pair of Armoured Gauntlets
- Helm of Dark Dwarvish Metal Design

MC casts Identify on the Dark Helm...

**Dread Helm** --> XP

- Makes your eyes glow red while you wear it.
- Gives +2 AC, 5 lbs.
- Heavy plate armor.
- If being pushed by effect, can use action to use resistance toi reduce distance moved by up to half.

**Gauntlets of the Ogre Power** --> TH

We setup camp in the secret room, taking turns guarding before the hearth.
We will take a long rest here and resume next session at full status.

These spiders are sky blue and white with bluish eyes.

We coordinate an attack on the first spider..

Suddenly it ripples along its abdomin and disappears.

DB 20
MC 16
XP 4
Spider
TH 1

#### ROUND 1

DB cast shower of sparks but they bounce in empty space where the spider was.
MC steps back out throug the door and takes cover, hiding to regain advantage.
XP draws his bow and holds action until he sees an emeny.
Spider makes self visible, blinking into existence over Thorune and drops onto dropping onto his head, but it fails to bite him.
XP fires his bow (rolls 7+3) at the spider but the arrow just flies wide and misses.
TH swings with his sword and misses.
TH attacks again, hitting (two handed - 10+1+4), jabbing the sword up into the spider and igniting the fire.
The spider screetches and shrivels as it disappears ina puff of bluish smoke.
VICTORY!!

##### END BATTLE

There is no corpse to search. =(

We coordinate around the second spider rooom in the north.
DB and MC climb up through teh rat tunnels and enter the room south of the spider.
XP and TH take the stairs and approach from teh western door.
TH sees another spider in the distance, but it is not alerted to theor presence.
One vbeast at a time.

Using sending stones we coordinate the attack.
TH and DB fling open the doors.
XP fires with advantage, hitting with a perfect Nat 20, hitting for 18 points damage (7 + 8 + 3)
MC hist with 16, inflicting 21 DMG (10 +1 + (6 + 5 + 1))
The spider shrivels and dies as it fades from existence, like the other.

There is one more spider remianign in teh main chamber beyond the door TH and XP entered through.
We regroup to cleanse the dwarven ruins.

We attempt to trick the spider by luring it to the portcullis to shoot it, using mage hand to make noise, but our ruse triggers its cloaking/warp ability and it disappears.

We quietly post up and send in Fenster as a cat, where he lures out teh last spider in front of the portcullis.
XP is still posted up in the long straight shot.
TH and DB post up and wait, MC hides behind a column with line of site.
MC summons Fenster and sends him into the room as a cat.
AFter a moment, the spider takes the bait, phasing into predatory existence behind the unwary Fenster.
MC snaps Fenster into the pocket dimension,and XP and MC fire at once.
Both hit, inflicting 35 damage and killing spider immediately, which again fades out and disappears.

Outside the portcullis facing North, to the front of the foprtress, XP thinks he sees something, but it is gone by the time he turns to look.
We decide to press on.

MC sends Fenster down the ground floor bathroom holes where the disembodied hand was,
the walls are slickened and copralitic, forming a poo glass shit-sidian butt stone.
Each pooper has a unique shoot but they combine to a giant pit at the bottom.
Fenster only sees more poop and trash.

We will not soolve the mystery of "Where does the poop go in the Dwarven Fortress?" on this weeks episode of Questions with Fenster.
We explore teh grounds again, seeing nothing unusual.
The job appears to be done.

We decide to head back to Fandolin.

XP is checking his 6 after the red visual, but we return to town on a pleasant afternoon drive with no incident.
The town is warming up to us, Harbin himnself even waiting at his peephole to speak to us.

We recount our experiejnces to him, leaving out the connection to the Dead Hand Society we found in the Bannshee's presumed records book.

He rewards us with 250 GP for our completing the mission.

MC carefully asks about what Harbin thinks of the Dead Hand Society.
He says everyone knows them to be a fraternal, social charity org.

Ho can we follow up on this lead?

Leyal, of the Vail, could be contacted via the Inn of a Thousand Faces (House of a 1000 Faces).
Maybe Rance can courrier a message for us on the way to NeverWinter bia his magic campground?
In Phandolin, at Costco Butts they get shipments.
The herbalist also sales her wares through there.

We decide to go check in on the Bardcore Manor.
On our way we stop by teh stabl;es and ask for Rance.
The workman says he will likely be in tomorrow.
We ask him to nitify Rance we want to offer him a job.
DB tosses the boy 4 silvers and asks him to give the horses some appes and come tell us at the Manor if Rance shows up before we do.

Back ta the Manor, things are getting repaired, starting to look much better.
Starting to appear inhabitable.
There is a nice covered area to park the wagon and our horses.
A few workmen knocking off for the day greet us as they leave the keep.

The place is cleared of broken and dirty rugs and debris.
It is sparce in furnishnig, but it is tennable now.
