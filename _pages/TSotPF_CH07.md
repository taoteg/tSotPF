### DAY ?? (PART ?) [2022.11.12]

- We wake early, refreshed from a night's sleep, but wary of the journey ahead.
- A man comes and urgently begs DB to come with him, alone, and he can get the party a boat to Chult that afternoon, but ashe must come now and alone.
- DB says not a chance.
- TH steps out of his room and threatens the man.
- He tells TH that we do not understand, but leaves mumbling none the less.
- TH knocks on KC and XP, the party heads downstairs.
- As the party descends, a crowd of people press in on them, begging for help, justice and revenge.
- KArnon addresses the crowd, asking if they are all here for the Chult slavers, not everyone is.
- We tell the bartender, Bethesdah, to take down everyone's information and greivance.
- We also ask him to make note of any grievance related to Chult or the slaver ring.
- We take a seat and get breakfast, waiting to see if anythign happens.
- We weigh our options:
-- We can wait for Balthar to return.
-- We can wait for Athan Calder.
- Karnon asks Bethesdah if he has seen Athan, he says no.
- Karnon goes back upstairs and yells loudly for Athan Calder.
- He hears giggling in the room two doors down from his and the barmaids Athan had bedded the night before open the door and peek out.
- They tell Karnon "Hello Mr. Druid man, sir, what can we do for you?"
- They say Athan is gone, but we dont believe them.
- DB enters the room and searches for Athan, to no avail.
- Th barmaids ay he comes frequently, but isnt here now.
- We thank the barmaids and leave.
- We head back downstairs and go outside to look around.
- In the distance we see a giant ship docked, with huge metallic tubes of some mechanical kind strapped to its sides, a blue flame or magioc of some type visible jetting forth from one of the tube ends. Two long brass metallic bounds form a kind of rail surrounding the ship and poking out far ahead of the prow and trailing the aft portions of the vessel. There are shapes visible upon the surface of it, working and prepping - presumably to send a landing party ashore. For reasons that are not app[arent, the vessel is not coming in all the way to port, even though there is adequate space for it to dock.
- The peoples outside have mixed reactions to the spectacle, some dismissive of it as another privateer trying to turn a quick buck with a flashy rig, while others are genuinely curious about the exotic looking vessel and what it could be for.
- The party discusses swimming to the boat, but thinks it a ba first impression.
- Karnon offers ot turn into an eagle and fly the party over, but it is a lot of effort and wastes a wildshape use for little obvious result.

<<DM has gastrointestinal distress - MAYDAY! MAYDAY! Game Play suspended for the session. RUHROH! >>
{{ Plan to attempt next weekend (maybe), else Thanksgiving weekend looks pretty good, else the week after that for certain. }}
