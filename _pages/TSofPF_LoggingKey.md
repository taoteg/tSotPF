#### Logging Key

_NOTE: Logging for each gameplay session is grouped under the following heading format:_

`GAME WORLD DAY NUMBER (YYYY.MM.DD)`

_Where:_

- A horizontal divider indicates the start of each in-game calendar day.
- GAMEPLAY DAY NUMBER == the sequential number of in-game calendar days that have passed in the game since the campaign began.
- (YYYY.MM.DD) == the real world calendar date the gameplay session took place on.

Some in-game world days span multiple real world gameplay session calendar days and are appended with letters (ex. 12A, 12B, 12C).
