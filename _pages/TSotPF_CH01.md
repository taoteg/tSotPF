Ask about legend and myths:

- She says that a dragon has been seen.
  -- Gleaming white scales, large as an elephant.
- Tribore trail runs through the ruins of Conyberry (sacked by Barbarians years before Fandoliln)
  -- South of this location a ruined temple is supposed to contain hidden gold

- Fandolin is only a few years old (2).
- A great and large community used to exist here (many races in peace and harmony), name??
  -- Preceded Never Winter's existence (100s of years ago, 'Old Fandolin - Human Town allied with Dwarves and Gnomes')
  -- Rumors of people run out by creatures
  -- Dragon??

Thorune: Has anything of note been found around the town?

Halia: Battlements and foundations of buildings, the old temple in the town square, all of these preexisted 'New Fandolin'.

Halia: Pleasure to meet you. We are not high pressure, but prices fluctuate based on market (some).

2)) Lion Shield Coster (East center of town)

- Armorer & Arms

Sign above shield Kite Shield with Blue Lion on it.
Entering the establishment we see a gentleman, Rolf Greywind (human man, 38) and his partner Lanine Greywind (human woman, 35)
The establishment is clean, full mannequins with various levels of full armor.
Weapons plaque son the walls and chests about the room.
Tough's guarding front and back door (grayish tinge to skin of one fellow).
They greet us as we enter and offer us to look about.

Morthos: Can you identify theses magical items. Does it cost anything for service?
Rolf laughs and gestures towards Lanine to help.

Lanine looks at Crossbow first (tail to tip), test strings and mechanisms and says:

- Finely made crossbow (adds extra damage) [crafted by TBD, could be Elvish - but not certain].
- What would she appraise the value at?
  -- 70 Gp to sell there.
- 1d10 +1 damage (Fine Heavy Crossbow) [two-handed]

Looks at helmet next:

- Taken by make, engravings and etching, rubbing fingers over.
- Calls Rolf over to look at it.

QuarterStaff

- Donnabella winks and umps you and says (that's my ride)
- Basic 1d6 (2 Sp)
- Charred wood, black and shiny - legend says it was burned by Dragon Fire (if you believe it), but it passed all the tests I gave it, wouldn't break. Neither could the big grey guard guy. Unbreakable as far as they can tell. (2 Gp)
  -- Donnabella isn't digging it, seems too costly.

Rolf comments on Thorune's chest plate, says he would be happy to trade anything they have.
They get different stuff in and work with the Blacksmith.

Lanine emerges with the helmet, with a WOW gaze on her face.
"We do not know where you got the from, but my father says he doesn't know where it was mad but he's 90% sure its a helm of teleportation. While wearing this helmet you can use an action to cast teleport spell. It has 3 charges.
Can regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn - in the morning roll 1d3 and get those charges back.
Teleports wearer and 8 willing creatures of the wearers choice that they can see within range (10 feet) to a destination you select.
Can also teleport an object but must fit with a 10ft cube space.
You must know the destination, familiarity makes it easier to be successful. Destination must be known to you and on same plane of existence as you."

Valuation: Practically Priceless in this small community (can be negotiated, but...)
Armor Class: ???

Can it have ore charges?
No, unless you know a magical artificer that can manipulate it.

Thorune ask Lanine about the temple ruins to the Far East side of town.
Lanine: It is a ruined manor of the old Tressandor Family. By the time they got here it was already dilapidated.
Don't now if you know, but the town has been beset by beast both known and unknown.
Be careful where you go - especially after dark.

It is just after noon.
Zot is still in Inn.
We are ready to head to the Blacksmith when next we journey...

Note:

- Study the town closely before we adventure again so we can teleport there better in an emergency.
- DO NOT TELL ZOT ABOUT HELMET!! Use /w gm $MESSAGE

---

### DAY 5C (2020.05.31)

It is about 3pm.
We are still in Fandolin.

Not is in the Inn with incontinent whore bowel syndrome but we left with a sending stone so we can communicate with him.

Morthos, Thorune and Donnabella are going to Nomenguard to complete Board Mission C.

Perception check: Morthos - 20, Thorune - 1, Donabella 15
(All plus 1 in addition)

Heading south over grasslands form Fandolin.
No encounters up to mountain range on the southern border of the map.
A misty roar from the river canyon ahead indicates a waterfall in the distance.
An island appears in a streamlet before us, covered in rainbow colored mushrooms.
Morthos does a Nature check (Int): 14
Identifies: Shrooms 2-3 feet tall, Edible, Sometimes farmed

- Red
- Green
- Purple

Morthos casts Mage Hand:
Grabs 1 Red Mushroom
Grabs 1 Green Mushroom
Grabs 1 Purple Mushroom

There looks to be an order to their growth pattern.
Morthos stops at this point to avoid angering anyone in case this is a violation.
Donnabella nudges Thorune, points towards cave opening ago the cliffs round you.
Sound of the waterfall is deafening now, requiring hand signals to communicate.

See a cave entrance on a narrow ledge to go in.
As we go in we see a room with a table in it, otherwise the place looks oddly unloved in.
Morthos steps around a corner and gets shot in the butt with a crossbow bolt for 2 damage.
A cackling gnome reloads.
We attempt to negotiate.
She continues to fire at us.
She appears to be out of her mind.
She is an old gnome woman.
We attack the crossbow and light it on fire.
Morthos casts his voice to distract her, she turns around, Thorune rushes in, knocks over the crossbow and tackles her.
Thorune is holding the old frail gnome woman.
Donabella approaches and soothes the old woman.
She gives the indication that she is not retarded, not physically damaged but dimentia of some kind.
Thorune asks her name.
She shudderingly answers Fector.
Morthos attempts to calm her down.
"We are not here to hurt you, we will help you if you need it. We just want to ask questions."
She is mentally not there.
Examine the area before moving on.
Morthos is impressed by the little crossbow weapon.
Morthos makes an Int check to take pieces (17).
Some useful components to it (gears, cogs, ball bearings), but too difficult to disassemble right now.
One of the bows is burnt off now, otherwise it is intact.
The walls are smoother now and more finished, a lived in place.
Wall sconces, more decorations.
Heading down tunnel find a stairway down back to the mushroom cave.
Heading deeper there is a Wine cave.
It contains 12 large 40 gallon casks.
We leave our party here until next time...

---

### DAY 5D (2020.06.14)

It is now 8:30 pm.
Zot has joined the party.
We are in a cask room.
Go!

Thorune investigate the southern tunnel.
Runs into two Gnomes who challenge us.
Thorune asks if they have any weapons to help defeat a dragon (on behalf of Harbin Wester).
They don't trust us.
Morthos attempts to persuade them but fails.
Ulla and Pawg (the Gnomes) trust us after Zot makes a successful saving throw.
They think something is happening in the caverns that has spooked their chieftains.
Seek the gnome king in cavern east of here.
There is pair of kings having issues and need help.
Monsters seen and people are disappearing.
Walk down a corridor to the east and come out to a rope bridge crossing the cavern above the waterfall.
Bridge suspends about 20 feet above water, waterfall is 65 feet above.
Party crosses the bridge.
Come to a room filled with towers of whirling blades on stone columns.
Morthos uses Mage Hand to flip a lever across the hall and turn then off.
The party hustles through to the other side and continues down a tunnel.
We come to two gnomes working and arguing.
Fibblesticks and Dabbledob Are startled by our presence.
King Corbaws and King Gnurkley.
Fiddlestibs thinks Corbos ins crazy
He has Gnurkley locked up join chambers.
Dabledob says neither of them is right in the head.
One is glued to the throne, locked in the throne room.
What is the cuase of their madness?
No one knows.
We want to help them.
Fibblesticks wants to make a sanity ray.
Dabbledop wants to make a straight jacket.
They mention the missing villagers but the kings will know more.
Who else I share?
Group of us (point behind them down a hallway)... in bedchamber.
There us a stairwell that leads to Kings chambers.
Who to talk too first?
Gnurkley is the one tied to the throne.
Corbaws is in throne room with him.
Head down stairs.
Bunk room full of gnome workers.
Jabby the gnome says the mushrooms do things:

- Green grind up and make into bread (delicious - sustaining, lambdas bread)
- Red provide an oil (for lanterns and stuff, can be refined to burn, used also as lubricants for gear works)
- Purple shrooms are a favorite, crouched and fermented to make wine (taste like it sounds).
  -- Dragonbone Shroom Wine (makes gnomes get hard-ons)
  Jabby and Palabar have second cousins who went missing.
  No specific location, but seems to be common on eastern side of caves.
  Some may have gone missing outside the caverns, but they are not sure.
  There I no sign of blood or remains, but there have been sightings of very slick parts of rock.
- Ectoplasm like substance.
  Morthos does INT check (19)
- There are jellies and slimes, ogre jellies, gelatinous cubes, pseudopods (snail-like things) and spectral creatures all leave residue.
  Any indigenous slime leaving things?
- Recent in occurrence and much larger than any normal creature found around here.
  Do any of these creatures get huge?
  Jabby says he's heard stories of them, but not anything out here.
  Any odd discoveries recently I the caves? Or other weird events?
  Jabby says other than Fector sipping at concoctions we don't know much.
  Do you know anything about why the kings are fighting?
  Jabby says who knows? This is weirder than usual, but that's the ruling class...
  Do you know of anything that might help us in our quest?
  See Fibblesticks and Dabbledop. They make all kinds of magical items and otherwise.
  Who tinkers in magic aside from Fibblesticks and Dabbledop?
  Some underlings working for those two: Zook (in corner), Nix and Quippy are there.
  They probably don't know much about what going on, just following orders.
  Give Jabby the purple shroom for the help.
  Go back to Fibblestibs and Dabbledob.
  Did anything go amiss?
  Nothing has gone amiss.
  What have the got?
  They talk after we deal with the Kings.
  We convince them to open their storage room.
  It is jam packed with random assortment of gears, small bits of stiff, tinkerers paradise.
  Hopelessly unsorted.
  Morthos casts DETECT MAGIC.
  The dark room begins to glow a lavender colors.
- Amulet (glowing Lavender)
- Pole (glowing Lavender)
  We go ask Fibblesticks and Dabbledop if they know what they are?
- Pole of Collapsing (wondrous item, common, 10 ft pole allows user to speak a command word and collapse into 1ft long rod. Weight doesn't change, can use action to cause rod to revert to a pole. Will elongated only as far a surrounding space allows.)
- Clockwork Amulet (copper amulet with tiny interlocking gears, magic powered by mechanics the plane of clockwork predictability. Creature with ear to it can hear ticking and noise within. Attack roll wearing amulet allows foregoing d20 to get a 10 on the die.)
  Please don't take, they would be a reward for quest completion.
  Return to hallway.
  Enter throne room.
  Find secret doorway in back behind thrones.
  Go through secret tunnels.
  Find Corbaws...
  WTF is going on?
  Corbaws says he doesn't trust his friend.
  Corbaws is acting paranoid.
  Shape changer...
  His people tell stories about something roaming the halls that gets them.
  Ask him to let Gnurkley loose if we prove he is not the shape changer.
  Mortho's holds both their hands and casts Identify as Thorune stands by.
  Other than terrified gnomes, nothing unusual here.
  But as you cast it you recognize insubstantial motes of light surround you.
  Shedding bright light ten feet around, then ten feet of dim light.
  Strange things happen when spells are cast around here.

We leave our party hence.

---

### DAY 5E (2020.06.27)

RESUME

Gnurkley and Corbaws are still frazzled but now believe we are who we say we are (or are at least capable of spell casting).
Gnomes are going missing, shape changer encounters, no direct contact but anecdotal stories of sightings from credible sources.
No reports of humanoid creatures, only wall, columns, tapestries, etc.
Morthos INT check (10 +2)

- know that creatures re kinds of predators and can alter physical form to look like basic materials (stone, wood, metal - inanimate! etc).
- no changeling behavior, just camouflage...
  The Gnomes are tinkerers, crafters (mechanical, magical) and willing to reward us if we can prove we rid them of this threat.
- Maybe find some survivors??
  There are MORE items up for grabs if we can help!!

We head back to Ulla and Pawg and check in.
They ask about the kings, we say they are better but we need to find the creature to resolve the issues.
They have seen nothing since we were here, other than Fector wandering around...

We decide to investigate the cask room.
Thorune uses his True Strike to check the casks...
First two are just casks.
The third one reacts, begins to burble and writhe - revealing it true form.

Spell reveals this:

- Immunity to acid,
- immune to being knocked prone,
- limited perception (creature, dark vision),
- Its a pseudopod (like an ogre jelly),
- It can bludgeon with its mass
- It can bite
  MIMIC!!!!

Thorune calls Zot on the stone - he begins to run (30 feet at a time).
Meanwhile...

BATTLE ENDS
Zot arrives...

Zot fetches Ulla to verify the creature is dead.
She accompanies you to the Kings to prove it.
You bring pieces of the creature for proof.

The Kings ask her to verify it.
Korbaws demeanor changes, as though he wakes up from a spell.
He immediately walks over to the corner and grabs a flask from a chest.
Runs to Gnurkley, apologizing, pours a solvent on the bonds holding him.
The bonds dissolve, Gnurkley sees that Korbaws is returning to normal.
Korbaws: We cannot thank you enough. Did you see any survivors? They cast stereotypical suspicion on Thorune, but heap praise on us. How can we repay you?
MC: We are here about the dragon (they only know what we know by way of rumors). Any aide in our quest?

They give us the following items as gifts:

- Wand of Pyrotechnics
  :: Has 7 charges (use once as action - harmless burst fo light visible form 60 feet away, crackling noise heard 300 ft away, light bright as torch for 1 second.
  :: Regains all charges daily at dawn.
  :: If all 7 charges are used up, you can keep using it BUT is you roll a d20 it Weill explode in a harmless display of fireworks.

- Hat of Wizardy
  :: Wondrous item that requires atonement by a wizard.
  :: spell casting focus for wizard spells
  :: cast cantrip you not know on your wizards spell list , pass DC INT Check
  -- If it fails, action is wasted.

- Clockwork Amulet

- Pole of Collapsing

Gnurkley: Here is also a potion of healing (gives us a light healing).

- Minor health potion

Korbaws: Do you know if these things travel in packs or groups?
MC: We do not, but we will sweep the grounds before we go to make sure. Actually - just reach out to Fandolin if there is any further problems.

For now we will have a short rest to restore our spell slots and head back to town.

CRACKA RAY JAY ON YA PEEP!!!!

---

### DAY 6 (2020.07.11)

We rejoin the party at predawn... leaving the gnome caves we emerge to the realm.
The dragon screeches I the nearby region (near where the Herbalist was @ Humbrage Hill was).
It appears to be in our path of return to town, we can either slow down or head around it.
We decide to go around it.

Movement speed:

- (1.5) Fast pace, running away, miss things easily
- (1.0) Average, find more stuff, stay reasonably stealthy
- (0.5) Slow, takes longer but be ninja/doctor strange

We choose average.
We move West, several hours the dragon lurks in the near East hills.
After about three hours the dragon can be seen flying north east into the distance, over the ice spire peaks.

We decide to investigate the area while we are here.
It tajes us an hour out of the way.
The dragon has landed in the area for certain, and remains in the area doing arial sweeps - presumably for food, but we do not know what it is doing.
It has been nearby several times.

We examine the herbalists house again, nothing here.
We examine the Dwarves funerary cairns.
These are ancient sacred ruins, best left physically undisturbed.

MC casts Detect Magic and there are but slight motes emanating from the region.
The rocks have been unmoved for centuries, if not millennium.
Whatever magic was here has long since expired in power.

We decide to return to Fandolin, it takes another hour.
It is now early morning in Fandolin as our party arrives.

We first go see Harbin Wester... he asks "What news of Gnemonguard?"
We update him.
We offer him the wizard hat.
Harbin: Goodwork, thank you.
The hat is worth 50 Gp (considering effort).

MC does a charisma check - rolls 20 (+3 with charisma, plus skill bonus of Persuasion)
Harbin: Name your price:
Barter to 70 Gp.

He begins to slide the coins under the door one by one....
MC does a charisma persuasion check (19) and convinces Harbin to drop the bag of gold through slightly larger hole beneath the eye hole.

We now level up!!!!!!
LEVEL 4!!!!

### DAY 7A (2020.08.01)

The Dillemma of Zot (Giovanni's Departure)

Wake up to a Dear John note from Zot. He has left us in the night.

- Mountains Toe Quest - involves mountains toe goldmine. Located 15 miles North East of Fandolin. Don John Rasquin (traveling from NW to Fandolin, escort him to the mine. Dangers untold. Dliver to Harbin after safe driver for 100 Gp.

- Resistance (group buff)
- Chill Touch (spectral hand)
- Mending (within a 1 foot damage, including magic items - but won't make magic again)

5 Silver for Honeycomb.
5 Gold for 2 Load Stones

We decide to bury our sorrows in a visit to the mansion outside of town.
We enter the grandiose ruins, dimly lit with open sunlight streaming through broken parts of the ceiling.
Two grand staircases wind to the upper floor, a large concourse lies before the party.
Large columns line the sides of the foyer, disappearing into the ruinous rafters above.
The party sees a single door to the left of the entry, they enter.
It is a simple mudroom for cloaks and boots, a simple chair lies in ruins, a beaureau fallen into splinters.
Another door lies to the right, we enter.
Within lies a once luxurious den, a hearth in the corner has crumbled to dust at the edges.
The tattered fur of a animal rug lies atop cracked stones, under the fragments of ancient furniture.
Nothing of value seems to have survived.
The outer North wall streams in sunlight from a gaping hole, torn asunder by time.
We exit back into the central corridor beneath an archway, mirrored across the walkway by another great room tat was once a dining hall.
Within the remains at the rear is a locked door, amazing having withstood the tortures of time.
MC rolls 7, then 17 and manages to open the two tumbler lock.
The door opens to reveal a decent sized door with a decent lock.
The room within is. small den or library, for private conversation and reading.
It is in better condition than the rest of the building, damp and dank but not fully rotted into decay.
It appears untouched for many decades.
DonnaBella reviewed the history of the Trascendar Family, who fell just after the Orcs had destroyed this place.
Another door lies to on the southern wall, small windows deeply set in the ceiling reveal a tiny bit of light.
MC examines the hearth but sees a creosote packed chimney, cobwebs and the carcasse of several animals.
Under the grate of the fire pit there is evidence of a perforation to exist, revealing tiny slats carved into a stone plate beneath the fire.
Thorune lifts the great up, Morthos ties a rope around it and lifts with his crowbar ad Thorune yanks it from the hearth.
A queen from beyond the grave mists across their faces.
Morthos peek in and sees a landing about 9-10 feet down, no other meaningful marks.
The rock is hewn smooth but not even, an opening revealing back under the room the party is standing within.
The tiniest hint of light appears to radiate from deep within the bowels of the ruins.
The door on the wall reveals a decayed storage room.
Morthos drives pitons into the grate cover, and tosses the rope down the hole.
As they drop into the hole he cuts 35 feet of rope from the end, just in case it is needed.
Within lies a goblin underling staring into the pool within the small room, next to another goblin corpse face down in the dirt.
Morthos unleashes an arrow that splits the goblins head in twain, its innards flopping a wet splooge to the ground as the body falls face forward silently into the pool.
Examining the corpses reveals a small broken hand axe at his side, gross oozy goblin armor, nothing worth picking off.
The goblin Morthos slew had a base javelin, which Morthos adds rot his pack.
His meager coin purse reveals

- 1 Gold
- 6 Silver
- 17 Copper
- Strings of hairs
- Strange grimy pieces of shiny metal
  We take the money.
  Several of the casks within the room appear to be untapped, according to Belladonna.
  They taste good according to DonnaBella.
  Morthos fills his waterskin from his Dungeoneers pack with the wine.
  Walking through the second door into an underpass they come into a series of rooms like a prison with cells carved of stone.
  A goblin corspe lies within one.
  Through the double doors at the end of the hallway.
  Within lie 3 coffins.
  Thorune opens one, within lies a corpse robed in emerald green cloth.
  They appear to have been disturbed before.
  Thorune opens the second coffin.
  A female corpse lies within with finery and broken jewels.
  Someone has rummaged through the coffin as well.
  A broken Broche lies within the garments but nothin much more.
  The third coffin reveals an adolescent corpse, mouth agape, wrapped in blue crushed velvet.
  Morthos perception checks and sees what could be a deed to the property stuffed in the lining of the coffin.
- It is the Trascendar family manner house, property and 7 acres of land.
- Appears ot be. Legally binding document, though very aged - signatures are faded.
  Danger of falling apart.
  DonnaBella uses her mending cantrip to repear the deed, the ink remains smudged but the paper is now safe to roll up.
  Tone that up in ya puppy!
  Morthos investigates the holding cells.
  The corpse within one is freshly dead goblin.
  He has simple armor and bone jewelry.
  No coin purse or value in any evident way.
  However he appears to have just died of natural causes.
  No evident trauma.
  The other room door reveals a small hallway with a locked door at the end.
  Morthis attempts to pick it... twice... and fails...
  He must have drank too much wine.
  Throne muscles the door open and within lies a room of old tools and weaponry.
- a One handed battle axe. (Thorune takes)
- a dagger. (Morthos takes)
- a short bow (sapling) (Morthos takes)
- a mace (Thorune takes)
- a chainmail shirt (medium armor, 20 lbs, silveis, good condition) (DonnaBella holds)
  Nothing else is found, though a sense of something undiscovered persists.
  We return to the last door by the fountain and enter.
  There are two beds and empty boxes within, waiting to be filled with wine presumably.
  Nothing more is found, though Morthos fails to find anything.
  DonnaBella double checks because Morthos is stupid drunk on wine.
  On the way out we reexamine the fountain and several ruptured casks.
  There seems to be tracks into the corner of the room.
  Morthos finds what appear stocks be a hidden panel.
  Revealing a hidden lock that opens to reveal a thin corridor.
  Morthos sneak to the end of the corridor where it turns and peeks.
  Around another corner, a step up, stands an armored guard (6.5 feet above us).
  Morthos sneaks into the chamber and scopes out the area.
  The guard remains unaware.
  Morthos attempts to execute the sentry, sneaking up behind him and drawing his daggers.
  At point blank range, somehow, he misses the guards throat.
  As he backs away the guard detects his scent.
  Morthos pulls out his short sword and swings at the guard.
  He misses again.
  COMBAT!!!
  ORDER - Thorune, Guard, Morthos
  Thorune runs up and jumps atop the platform as the sentry sees them.
  He slashes him with his sword in a mighty swing (18)
  Thorune strikes I'm across the torso, cutting him deeply and badly.
  He is bloodied.
  Morthos swings his short sword form the other side and misses.
  The Sentry turns towards Morthoss and strikes out in a frenzy.
  He strikes Morthos for 6 points of damage with his short sword.
  DonnaBella drops him with Eldritch Blast cantrip, incinerating his remains.
  The larger sentry is alerted.
  Morthos sneaks atop the ledge behind him and peeks into the room beyond.
  A very large goblin awaits within the room.
  THorune drops to a knee and Waites.
  DonnaBella drops into the ravine and hies beneath one of two bridges spanning the shallow galleys.
  Morthos waits for the sentry to cross out of view fro the larger fella.
  Morthos takes advantage, sneak attack - and shoots him into the back of the head, driving a bolt through his throat for 7 damage.
  DonnaBella moves forward to see what happens, prepping her crossbow.
  She sees the sentry and hits him for 4 in the sternum for a tracheotomy.
  The sentry is staggering on his feet, gurgling.
  Morthos misses.
  DonnaBela misses.
  Morthos drops him with another shot for 7 damage.
  Morthos uses his mage hand to distract the larger guy.
  He hits him with Poison Spray and Sneak Attack (14 damage).
  The goblin is staggered and sizzling.
  DonnaBella yells for Morthos to move, he withdraws to the ledge below Thorune.

Thorune leaps from the ledge above and charges the goblin, slashing him across the back of the head for 4 damage.
The goblins head cleaves smoothly form his body and he falls to the ground.
Blood and innards spill forth and he is no more.

Donnabella examines the sentry.
He had a shield, short sword and some grotesque armor.

- Short Sword (DonnaBella)
- Shield (Thorune takes)

Thorune examines the larger goblin.

- Polearm/Halberd (Morthos takes)
- A partial note:
  "...into the west. You and your band send back half of all treasure, 10% of all food stuffs, to Angha Toll. His loyal raiders will know the gift of power and dominance in his own lands once the threat of the white wyrm has passed." ~ Virsa Ka'hl.

Morthos finds a sack and a few chests form the corner.
Within we find precious stones:

- 3 red rubies
- 5 green emeralds
- 3 blue sapphires
- 250 Gold
- 37 Silver
- Trinkets (rings and such)

We will pause our adventure here for the night.

Frothy dog bung water or ASMR with lesbians.

---

### DAY 7B (2020.08.08)

We resume!

Thorune finds some bioluminescent algae (moss) for his Cantrip of light.
We explore around the Northern end of the far side, following a set of stairs down to a tinkerers workshop.
In the back lies a hollow wall.
Stairs lie beyond.

Down the stairs is darkness.
Thorune casts the Light cantrip upon the length of his sword, casting shadows down the tunnel wall as they grow into pure cave walls.
Phosphorescent moss clings to yet slick and damp cave walls.
There is a moldy taste of stale air.
Ahead lies a split, to the left the passage curves away into further passage.
To the right it turns to hard to the right and back away.
The party chooses to move forward to the left.
The tunnel opens into a larger room continuing left.
This cavelike alcove opens up to the left, about 55-60 feet are the end.
It also opens up to the right side again.
We stay to the left and move into the cavern area.
Morthos leads, dragon vision seeking movement.
Thorune holds center, lighting for the group with his sword.
Donnabella brings up the rear, watching for danger.

Within the area is evidence of MANY spiders or a large spider.
Morthos lights a torch and casts a mage hand cantrip, dragging the torch about the room looking to see what might be here.
We see more slickness and lichen, the sound of millions of tiny legs and pincers begins to echo about the cave.
Donnabella casts an Armoring spell on herself to reinforce her defense.
We withdraw from the room as quickly as we can.
We see a giant spider clamoring across the ceiling (about 15ft above us), looking to intercept us.
We engage in combat!

Order:

1. Thorune (TH)
2. Morthos Creed (MC)
3. DonnaBella (DB)
4. Giant Poisonous Spider (GPS)

Thorune casts true strike on GPS:

- dark vision,
- blind site (even in absolute black)
- stealth bonus
- poison fangs (hemotoxins)
- slow or grapple with web discharge

Thorune takes a defensive posture.

MC casts Fire Bolt for 5 damage.
The flames lick forth across the ceiling, burning webbing for 15 feet in all directions.
The stench of hair and carapace fills the air.
Morthos takes a defensive posture with his Halbeard.

Thorune cast Sacred Flame but missed (saving throw).

BellaDonna moves 10 feet closer to the exit.

The spider moves across the ceiling towards the cave entrance about 20 feet, up and to the right.

Thorune casts Burning Hands, stabbing his hand in the ground and casting flames upon the Spiders thorax.

DonnaBella dodges the flames as the spider takes a hit from the code of flame for 11 damage.
The spider cringes and tenses in pain, it is wounded badly.

Thorune pulls his sword from the ground and takes defense.
Morthos casts another Fire Bolt, hitting for 8 damage, singing the spider to near immobility.
It flails about on the ground.
DonnaBella launches a vicious Eldritch Blast, crumbling into a moist pile of waste and goo.

We raise our torches and look around.
We resume adventuring to the left.
A rounded cave wall curls away from us.
On the right we see a cavern with a mound about 25 feet from within the center of the room.
Magehand grabs the surface and pulls, like a cloak, but it is partially hung.
There is a pile of detritus hung here but the fabric is hung.
The mage hand uses a torch to reveal a cloak that is covering skeletal remains covered in webbing.
There does not seem to be any Giant Spiders on the ceiling here.
Morthos rolls 17 for stealth, and approaches the body.

The cloak is trashed, the skeletal remains are desiccated - sucked dry.
It was humanoid... but little else is evident.
Beaten boots and a belt lie with it.
There is a small bag or backpack that is in better shape.
We take the backpack and upend it.
An old scimitar, a scepter and tons of scrolls and stuff fall out (all turning to dust as it falls out).
It appears to be a bag of holding.
The items coming out appear to be useless or worthless.

We take the bag off holding.
YAY!!!!

We mark the floor to remind us of our way back.
We continue wrapping around, veer left and go north (back towards entrance it a veering northeastern path.
The path reduces to a 9 foot diameter.
At that point we see the wall on the right opens up sharply.
On the left the wall goes straight north.
This opens into a large cavern to the right.
The ceiling begins to lift up to about 35 feet.
To the left there is an opening about 20 feet left.

Morthos extends mage hand torch into the larger cavern on the right.
The ceiling and walls extend beyond the torch light and the dragon vision.
Both right and left (beyond the aperture on the left) there is a wall and a jetty but the cavern continues into darkness.

We move towards the opening on the left side, cautiously and alert.
The opening is about 11 feet wide, another choke point in the walls forming a hallway entrance of sorts.
It grows darker within the room...

As we enter the room we perceive little, but dexterity checks abound.
Morthos rolls 20 +4, instinctively grabbing hold of the cavern wall.
DonnaBella matches.
Thorune falls straight into 15 foot pit and takes bludgeoning damage (8 points).

We can cross the gap (8 feet) if we are careful.
The hallway bulges open a bit after the pit trap.
Ahead we see (to the left) the mortar work of a well perhaps.
There is another opening beyond into a larger cavern.

We approach the well structure (40 feet away).
The cavern opens up around.
There are carvings on the well ,runic, they fluid in the well glows blue as we approach.

Morthos casts Comprehend Languages.
The ancient runes reveal it to be a Pool of Healing (written in prose).

- Restorative powers.

Morthos dumps out his wineskin and fills with the restorative waters.
Thorune drinks from the waters with his hand, receiving 8 points of healing.

We stop here for the week....

---

### DAY 7C (2020.08.15)

Resuming at the fountain of health....

Morthos sneaks along the wall (22 for stealth).
Sneaks into a cavelike room.
Sees an old ruinous remains of a bed and storage.
Many shrooms growing in the room.
Morthos creeps around a stalagmite, and thinks he sees s something like a walking mushroom move in the corner when suddenly he triggers a strange mushroom to suddenly stand up and begin shrilly screaming, triggering a biological alarm.
Morthos attempts two chop it down, hitting twice for 4 damage each time, but the shroom continues to emit its shriek.
The shroom continue to squeal.
Thorune and DonnaBella run into the room having heard
From the archway beyond a horde of skeletons in armor begin to emerge in a shamble.

Morthos slashes the Screamer with his double daggers for 4 damage, finally ending its debilitating shriek, then he steps back behind the stalagmite and pulls out his crossbow.

Thorune slams his sword into the ground and casts Burning Hands on Fred and Steve, but Steve evaded.
Fred takes 12 damage, nearly done for.

We enter the room to the East of the entry passage.
It is filled with barrels, setup as tables.
There seems to be a half baked mining operation going on.
We creep about, looking into a passage splitting to the North-West.
There is blood on the floor of the passage.

To the south of the room lies a small area, with noxious spores and shrooms within.
They look unnatural.
Decrepid steps lead to the entrance passageway.

Morthos casts magehand to examine the mushrooms.
As he moves them across the center of the area, an ice trap explodes the hand into frosted mist.
Morthos takes 5 frost damage.
The ground below the area glows in a strange runic pattern, ice filling a radius of 15 to 20 feet.

Morthos steps back further, to the edge of the mage hadn't limit, and tries again.
This time nothing happens.
Morthos leaps onto the spot and back off again, ready to use his acrobatics if he needs.
The trap is no more.
Morthos examines the room and the shrooms very closely.
The green glowing shrooms spores move towards Morthos' foot in a cloud group, but withdraw in a birdlike flock when Morthos moves away.

We decide to burn the room down.
DonnaBella casts Sacred Flame on etc pile of shrooms.
It hits them and melt them away after several castings.
She repeats the process on all the green spores.

Morthos enters the room again and checks for hostile movement.
Nothing seems to be happening.
We examine the room and find nothing of interest.
Beneath the trap area there is remnants of the sigil, int not much.
There are gunpowder remnants.
Otherwise nothing of note.

We reenter the main room above us again, headed North.
The fire pit hearth on the right (East) seems oddly raised.
There are strange scratches around the torches.
Something scratching the marks left a piece of bone digit in the stone at the back.
Morthos pulls forth the bone piece from the wall in the back of the hearth.
It looks as though it is quite aged.

The party decides to return to the crypt rooms above, where a bed was located, and sleep.

### DAY 8A (2020.09.05)

We resume fully rested.
We decide to head back to town and check in with Harbon on the property deed and the weapons.

It is 8am in the early morning, on the hillside of the manor we overlook the city of Fandolin.
It is a beautiful view and we admire it before heading into town.
We got Harbin Wester and ask about the goblin note.

HW: The Ka'al family is powerful in the highest level of local goblin government.
Thorune: Where could we find them?
HW: He doesn't know. Part of why we were called here is because of the strife with creatures fleeing from the Dragonspire mountain from the dragon. These are uncommon in this are for some time now.

MC: What about the Trascendor manor and family? Who owns the property?
HW: The township took control of it but its not being maintained or upkeep. It is just there for now. Why do you ask?
MC: We liked it, what if we found the deed?
HW: We would approve its legitimacy and you would own it. We can rent it if we trade for maintenance.
MC: Presents the deed and says we want to claim the property.
HW: It is up to us, but as the emissary I can give you a receipt of transfer. He shuffles off to the corner, writes a decree of property exchange, and writes a record. It will get sent to the local government later today. It intrigues him but that's all.
MC & Thorune sign the receipt.
MC: Fare HW goodbye and head back out on the quests. HW reminds us to get his brother at login camp.

Head to Lions Shield Coster and enter.

### DAY 8B (2020.09.26)

We resume our quest to flrok morgen tweetblorgens place to get gems appraised.

Ardra Flintset - geology, archivist, record keeping, mining records, etc.

- She buys our gems (emeralds, sapphire) for 4200 GP.
- She asks about the porperty lease and why we gave it to Harbon.Warns of about Harbins perhaps shady
  dealings with our property ownership (keep her in the loop).

While discussing our plans, a fella named Rance (Paul?) offers a ride in his cart for a silver.
We take the ride to arrive within a day at NeverWinter.

(narrative)
As the party boarded Rance's wagon, he flicked the reigns and the horses began their steady trek towards NeverWiniter.

Rance turned toward the party and began to make small talk.
"Name's Rance, Rance Aul, what might I call you feller's by?"
"I am Morthos Creed, though my comrades in arms call me Slen," Morthos replied cordially.
"And this young lady is Donnabella".
DonnaBella smiled at Rance.
He grinned back kindly and turned towards Thorune.
"And who might you be, big fella?"
"I am Thorune of the Dragonborne."
"Good to meet you, big fella."
Morthos leaned forward and loudly whispers to Rance "Be careful or he'll ask you about his burnt stick."
Thorune gave Morthos a deadpan stare, then turned to Rance.
"Do you happen to have a lighting scorched stick or branch?"
"A what now?" Rance ask, clealry confused.
Donnabella giggled as Morthos covered his mouth and snickered.
Thorune glared at them both before continuing.
"A piece of wood that has been struck by lightning, do you have or know of one?"
"Sorry friend, can't help you there." Rance replies.

Rance seemed to immediately recall some other tidbit to relay and rambles on as we drive for the next few hours.
Eventually he mumbled on about dragons and treasure.
The party perks up and asks him to elaborate.
He tells us of old legends say the reason Old Fandolin fell was notbecuase of orcs or other like, but instead it was a dragon.
The dragon brought a blight (not just physical loss of crop and livestock but a spiritual blight on the land).
No one knows how long ago this was... it appears to be cyclical.
Some say the cycle is 100 years, some say 500, some say over a thousand...
Its not that anyone is wrong, but that everyone remembers different times of the events.
How old are you for example?

Morthos says he is 45.
Thorune says old enough.
Rance points out that some creatures can live up to a thousand years.
Someone 50 year sold may never have experienced it, its a myth to them.
Someone who is 500 years old may have direct experience.

Thorune ask if he has seen the dragon nearby.
He says oh yes.

Morthos asks if its the same dragon or if its a different one....
Rance says it is unclear.

- Burned the town down
- Froze town
- Town exploded in sparks of energy

It is unclear what truly happened in Fandolin.

He also thinks that the dragons take their treasure and horde it there.
Some say there is a dragon burial ground between Fandolin and NeverWinter.

Morthos offers Ranc some magic water to heal, Rance accepts.
Rance says the water is delicisou but not doing anythgin special.

Morthos invetsigates his waterskin and sees that the water is now plain clear water,
no longer the blue tinged glowing liquid from yhte well.
We wil need to investigate this more thoroughly.

As we head north, about halfway, the terrain begains to reveal the ocean to the West and
form natural mounds between the NW Woods to the East. The sensation of a geographic choke point emerges as well.

The mounds begin to grow taller and break the treeline visibly.

There is talk of more banditry along this stretch of the highway than others, but nothign unusual about that per say.
Down near Laylon (south) there is takk of forest bogey men, but nothgn of the like up here.

Angha Toll, Thulsa Ka'an? Know of them Rance?
The Toll is the Khan, power lineage - leadership or chieftains.

Usually he passes through here around 10:30 or 11am on his way to Fandolin from NeverWinter every 2 or 3 days.
He asks to stop at a campground nearby that os beautiful.
He says it is union rules to stop every 10 hours.
Rance makes camp.
We join him.

We quietly agree to keep a lookout for #StrangerDanger.
Morthos takes first watch.
Rune takes second watch.
Donnabella takes last.

The night begins uneventfully.
Morthos rolls a check (d20 --> 10).
Morthis feels almost like he is sleep walking through shift.
About 2:30 he alerts Rune.
Rune takes his shift.
Morthos lays down, but does not sleep.

Rune rolls a check (d20 --> 12).
Rune sees nothing unusual either.
At about 5 he swaps with Donnabella as the sky brightens.
Rune also lays down but does not sleep.

DonnaBella rolls a check (d20 --> 11+3).
She sees nothing, as though we are tucked away from it all.
Something about this place emits peace and tranquility, a restful sleeplessness.
We make it through the night.
