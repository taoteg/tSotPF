# The Phandolin Four Saga

## Chapter 2: Dragon of Icespire Peak and the Lost Mine of Phandelver (cont'd)

---

### DAY 9A BEGINS

In the morning Rance wakes promptly, loads up and prepares to resume our journey.
While Rune pees off the cliff, Morthos asks Rance how long he has been coming to this place.
Rance says about 35 years he has known about it.
He tries to stop here every time he has the opportunity (within 50 miles of this place).

Morthos asks how he found the place?
Rance says it just happened, he just stumbled upon it and just kept coming back.

Morthos decides to cast Detect Magic and circle the camp site.
He almost detects something, like strange distortions, but no clear aura on any objects.
There is no clear answer as to a source or school of magic.

Rune looks to see how low the water is below the cliff.
It appears 35-50 feet down.

Morthos casts a spell of Identify quietly and touches Rance on the shoulder,
thanking him aloud for showing them the campsite while secretly testing him for enchantment.
Morthos detects nothings.
"You are quite welcome, but lets keep this site on the hush if you dont mind," Rance replies.
Morthos agrees, still confused by Rance and this place.

<< We end here for the night...>>

---

### DAY 9B (2020.10.10)

We make our way North and finally appraoch Never NeverWinter.
Rance takes us into the city, it stretches out across the country side.
We make our way to the river slits the city in half.
We seek the fishing warf and ask for Rance to drop us off there to find a boatman to take us upriver.
Rance does as we ask and we find a fleet of available boatmen of various types.

We negotiate with several boatmen for a rate to go upriver to the Logging camp.
We recruit a 13" tall cat who speaks and has a boat to take us upriver to the Logging Camp for 10 Gp.

-10 GP - BOATMAN FARE

The river is busy and we make our way slowly through the crowded bay to the mouth of the river and begin heading upriver.
We wondwr how the small cat with tiny paws can captain sucha craft, but he seem to make it workers.It is about 10 and teh city stretches away for severla miles to our left on the North.
In the distance we see small outposts, and the river begins to wind and bend, the city disappears behind us around the curves.
Small fishing traps begin to appear along te riverside, the rural folk and the life beginnign to dominate the countryside. These are not commercial fisheries, but smallscale familiy and village sie operations.

The poeple we encounter look at us with interest, neither friendly nor hostlie, simply assessing these strange traveller sthat have enetered their waterways.

After several hours the cat offers us some shredded cat jerkey to all three of us. Thorune and Morthos accept the offer and chew it up.
It is a salty, complex flavor with a fishy aftertaste. It is complex and good after all.

We thank the catman, leaning his name is Hunt.
He asks us ours, we tell him.
We ask him about the loggers camp and the river.
He says they are always hiring, new loggers going up and not coming back. Its often enough to be a known issue.

We question Hunt about the loggers camp and the river, but he says the river is weird. He bids us stick a hand in the river, its not a prank.
Morthos and Rune do it, the water is very warm - almost boiling.

Morthos asks if there are any known dangers or traps along the river. As he asks, a hissing metllic noise issues form the trees, the sound of a giant creature rumbling in the distance.

Hunt emphasizes that he knows nothing of many things that are in the woods, and he never intends too.

Thorune asks if there are any lightning struck trees?

Thorune realizes he is lightning blech and can strike a stick himself.... he will do so tonight.

We banter, discussing his trade (which he will not reveal the secrets of) and the camp. He does not admit to using any maginc to navigate his craft, but he winks when called a tiny wizard by Morthos.

The forest proper engulfs the river as we enter the woods, heavy sycamores that seem weighted with age loom above the waters surface.

Hunt looks nervous and we all go into a guarded state.
Morthos takes the prow, on lookoutt - rools a 18 for perception whie holding a loaded crossbow and and an action.

Rune is in the middle and DOnnabella stays in the aft.

Something huge moves and rumbles on the North side of the riverbank (150 yards away)...Hunt veers towards the southern bank.

We watch as it veers inward towards the forest and either growa to far away to hear or has grown still, either way it is no longer audible.

Hunt is on extreme edge, eyes looking warily in all direction.
Morthos asks if thta is usual. Hunt says not exactly.

We decide to quietly, slowly proceed.
The darkness feels heavy, creeping over the party like a dense fog.
It begins to darken, a half light choking out the light through invisible fingers.

We finally arrive at the logging camp pier.
After bartering with Hunt to remain and wait for us he declines 20 GP, saying its too much risk.
He submits to 30 GP but says he has no way to protect himself.
We ask if he would come in with us.
He looks skeptical.
He says I will pull up here at the end of the pier (about 40 yards out) and wait for about an hour.
We ask if there is anywhere we should go first.
He says that down and off the right there is an office.
We decide that Donnabella should stay with Hunt while we investigate.
Morthos and Rune take the crates and head up the pier towards the offices.

As Rune and Morthis walk across the 18ft atll pier they see a shotgun cabin and the makings of some camp buildings and tents.

we approach a window in the closest wall.
Within it is a man who is terrified, huddled behind a wall of furniture packed to hold the door shut against some unseen threat.

Mortos knocks lightly on the window.

"Excuse me, are you Mr. Wester?"
The man looks startled and stares at the Demon in the wondow.
"Its okay, we are here on behalf of your brother. We came to bring supplies and check on you. "

MC: WHats going on?
TW: Have you seen them?
MC: Seen who?
TW: monsters (acts out crazy)
MC: No but come with us now out the window.
TW: No.
MC: Going to come in and get you.
MC: Lights torch, hands to Rune, goes into window.
MC: Come with me.
TW: Excuses...
Beast banging into door intensely.
MC: Enough - drags TW to window and hands to Rune.
R: Drags TW out window.
MC: Jumps out window as beast charges through door.
In the light it reveals itself to be a chitnious many legged claw and mandible creature thing, lobstrosity meets insect meets spider.

He ask us to send anyone his way who is willing to come work and lend a hand rebuilding.

We float into the North of the river and begin our journey.
Hunt thanks us for our patronage but is glad to be alive in one piece.
MC asks him if hes ever seen one of those bgs before or heard of them.
Hunt sys theres all kind of crazy creatures.
He peers into the forest frightened.
We hear screeching in the disance, North in the forest.
Hunt is watching the woods.
MC asks if he knows what that is.
Hunt says that is a BIG bird!
Do not go into the forrest, unless there is GOOD reason.

DB asks Hunt if they have any books?
Yes, they have all the books!

Again from the forrest comes the sound of something large.
MC ask if there is anything we can we do?
Yeah, grab an oar and help.
We all lean in and row.

...

Head to center of government to look into land deed.
MC rolls perception 16.
Detects that the streets are nice, but very austere at the same time.
At the base of one building there is a graffiti symbol.
It could be etched into the footstones event.
Half-lidded eyeball surrounded by 3 stars in teh shape of a triangle (not connect, but arranged that way).
Run into a fancy, well dressed pseudo military regalia encrsuted government official.
"May I help you."
"I am here to inquire about the land ownership of an area near Fandolin."
"We are turned away."
(After Morthos makes a failing intimidation check)
The man closes a plexiglass window.
Thorune attenots to intimidate, flaring his power.
He rolls a 2, and knocks himself down, smoke shotting from his ears.
Donnabella ask where to lookup the land deed on behalf of Harbin Wester.
"What is your name."
Bloke Redstar.

Morthos persuades (17) Bloke for 10 GP to aid the party.
Bloke says "You will want to Master Winter."
Where might we find him?
Master Gable Winter, inside, ask for him.
Second floor, facing the rotunda.

"Thank you, Bloke!
Its good to know you are susceptible to bribery@ I'll see you later. Dont worry, I wont tell anyone. Have a happy day."

Bloke does not see encouraged.

We are ushered up to see Master Winter. He asks what we want.
Morthos explains the interest in the land abstractly but in detail (without mentioning names)...

He finds the docs and says he has heard of us, and good things, but looking at the docs it could go several ways.

- Fandolin is an important outpost for NW.
- The council would like to extend a writ on the property to you in a mannner that is a service lease.
- You and your party could grow to own it.
- Your service to the land could be your payment to ownership.

How do we fulfill the lease?

- Restore the manner to its former state.
- Continued interest in supporting NW in Fandolin and abroad.

What if we want to just sell the property?
Winter - it is not clear cut at all.
He seems to want to make it work, but it is hard.

Who owns it then?
Who is the council taking this from?
Feudalist explanation - NW assumes control beyond its boundaries.

Why the interest in it now, if it is in such a pathic state?
NW does so now by providing the people of Fandolin the opportunity to live here.

We discuss it and agree that we would be interested in a lease.

Public library on the south east fro the government building.

- There are private collectors, and sellers in town.
  -- The Owl's Sheath (North of Castle Never)

The document would be ready to look over tomorrow around 10:30 amiss.

The Black Light of Tear
The Dacented Bull - Arlef (All manner of clothing & enchantment - appt only)
Fine Spirits - Acquire for later

We tell him that we bribed the official to get in.
He says he takes it seriously.
He thanks us for our help and information.
He says to speak to Arlef at Bull.
He says give a 15-20% discount if they want his business again.

We walk back out by Bloke and taunt him.

It is now midmorning.

Thorune has no specific needs.
DB and MC want to head to Decanted Bull.
We cross Sleeping Drsgona and behold Castle Never.
It is a sight to behold.
As we make our way into the market district up northward, we bump into a hoooded person.
She is almost silent but she is a cat person.
She asks - Have you seen the eye?
Then begins to walk away....
then disappears.
Thorune tells MC.
MC asks where she went.
Donnabella tries to do investigation, nothing really.

Rune asks if she resembled Hunt.
The cloak was ornage, inside yellow (reversible)...
She was MUCH taller than Hunt by far (humanoid).
White coat with black stripes (light).

We continue at the Decanted Bull.
A young man greets us pleasantly.
We tell him Winter sent us to see Arlef.
He says it is him.
What are you looking for?

Morthos says he wants anything to do with stealth, persuasion or invisibility, silence, etc.
Thorune wants nothing but cod pieces.
Donnabella has interests...

Morthos rolls a persuasion check.
Arlef offers a 10% discount.

We show Arlef the note from Winter.

### DAY 11 (2021.11.14)

We have a leisurely breakfast and head to the magistrates quarters about 10:20 am.

A young owmn is at the post formerly occupied by Bloke Redstar.
She waves us in without hesitation, a loo of recognition on her face.
We enter with our writ, unused.
We approach the Magistrates chambers and he welcomes you in.

We say we are here for the papers on the property - the arrangement.

- Work on and repair property towards an assumption of ownership.
- Make it operable and produce resources and wealth!
- Until we abandon the property or are unable to afford/fulfill them, it is ours.
- We all sign off om it.
- Fix it up as you wish so long as it is brought to a stately state (not a rundown brothel).

Rune ask Winter if has heard of the Dead Hand Society.
He continues to dither over papers.
They do charitable work, are a fine group, support the library and temple.

Morthos asks if he knows anythign about their history.
He says not really, hes always known about them but they are just there.

Rune asks if they have a main location to find them.
He almost scoffs at this idea.

We ask how you contact them?
He says they find us or community needs.
Its is comprised of members of the community.
People work on behalf of the prder during their business affairs.
He was active in is youth with them legally.

The eye in the sigil is always watching out for never winter.
Seek the House of Knowledge for more info.

The Magister asks us to excuse him.
We take our leave.
Donnabella says something doesnt seem right.

As we make our was towards the Hall fo Knowledge, we bump into a little douche man at teh Wyvernb Bridge. Can I help you?

We are going to the House of Knowledge.

Ahh, seekers of the truth. Might I join you?

Sure, I guess.

Did I hear you say you wanted a turkey leg...?
Rune: No, lets go.

MC: No thanks. We didnt get your name?
Man: Yes, thats right (as he walks away over DOlphin bridge to the north).

As we approach the House of Knowledge, DOnnabella gets very excited.
Studious acolytes are all about.
We are met and ask to observe rules.
Some rooms need permission to view, the texts are ancient.
There are viewing room procedures for these.
Library rules.

Belladonna takes off to explore.
We ask where the ancient history is at.
We re tken into the huge building filled with antechambers of books.

Morthos looks into ancient hostory for mentios of the Dead Hand Society (DHS)...Rune loks for info on Black Lightning.

There was a dynastic governance for a long period in NW, after that failed eventulaly tp produce an heir (about the time the Mount Hautenel exploded creating a chasm in the city - during restoration phase) so there was a power vacuum for some time.
During that time, as the politics took root, you begins to see anecdotal reporting of DHS existing.
From what can be determined, they act about as the Magistrate said.
Classified as a fellowship centered aorund charitable civic responsibility.

Is there anyone associated with the group, founder or leader?
Nothing specifc, but an individual named Lord Dagult who assumed protectorship of NW is one of the first open political rulers affilitated with the DHS.

Now Silverhand is the lord of Waterdeep, who replaced Dagult (who returned to NW in retreat).

Perception (MC - 18, Rune - 12)
Morthos sees a hooded figure across the chambers, looking at them then turn away, kind of look cat like.

Morthos uses his glamour armor to appear as a cleric human and pursues her up the staors to the 3rd floor.

Rune follows Morthos up the stairs.

Morthos does not see her anywhere amodst the stacks of books.
Rune sees Morthos.
"Pssst! Morthos! Hey!"

A cat woman steps up next to RUne and waits for him to act.
Rune: "You are the same person who came to us in te street!"
CW: "You are a quick one!"
RUne: "Whay is the matter?"
CW: : "You have been getting serious attention in NW, do you always travel with so many eyes upon you?"
Rune: "Dragon borne are used to it."

Morthos sees them, hangs head in shame, and drops his disguise then walks over.
CW: "That is a handy trick! I appreciate skills like that."
MC: "Thanks you, and who are you?"
CW: "Well get tp that. Many are watching you. The man by the bridge, Leall, works for the city government as a spy."
Rune: "Should we fear this group?"
CW: "No one to fear, nothign like that. But their interests are not the same as the peoples of NW and the region. We do not see them benefintting the people so much."
Morthos: "And who do you represent?"
CW: I represent the Veil. We oppose the DHS, not for physical harm reaons, but we dont feel like the citizenry are recieving what they once did and the DHS is behind that."
Morhtos: "Is the DHS interested in power outside of NW?"
CW: "Yes they are expanding their reach."

Morhos" "What do you want with us Cat Woman?"
CW: "A welfare check, make sure you are aware of your situation and also ensure we dont do anything stupid."

Morthos: "What makes you say the DHS is not good for the people given their reputatio for charity and good deeds?"
CW: "They are no longer supporting the lower classes in the city, the differences between the haves and have nots are more extreme now. It is a mask of beneficence when they are takers."
Morhthos: Is there and end game or are they simply corrupt?"
CW: "It appears to be grab for power."

Rune: "How do you stop them?"
CW: "We intercede before the DHS does, beating them to the punch when possible. We distribute resources to the people most in need."

CW: "If you wanted to reach us again, the House of 1000 Faces is a good point of contact for us."

Morthos: "If you need to find us we are at Trysandor Manor."

Dialog continues about the nature of the DHS not serving society...

Belladonna walks up with a giant book.
She points at Cat Lady.
"Cat Lady?"
"Lady Lemiur"
"Ahh..."

She knows good craftsmen that do not have work we can hire.
The owner Tyreas at House of a 1000 Faces can contact us.
She says excellent, that is great.
I appreciate having met you.
I expect good things will happen.

We decide to go see the Chasm and Mascado's Map shop before we return to the Inn for the night. We will look for Rance in the morning to catch a ride back to Phandolin.

As we enter the Chasm area, the property and houses begin to reflect the decay of the region. At first the homes ra ewell kept, but as we move east they become shacks, then shanty housing made from refuse. There are decaying remains of once grand Manor houses, still being maintained but in a losing struggle.

As we move south towards the map shop we begin to get strange looks from street thugs. Donnabella is keeping a wary eye out.
Morthos is holding the lead, with Rune holding up the rear.

As we walk by a wagon a huge thug jumps out from the left and hits Rune in the head with a Mace for 7 damage then again for 6.
It is a surprise so the second thugs jumps Morhtos for the bag fo holding.
They grab the bag of holding and begins to Rune.
Morthos gets Attack of opportunity...

- Morthos casts Poison Spray and hits for 12 damage. The thief is hurt badly.
- The thief staggers and keeps running.

BATTLE!!!

- Rune
- Morthos
- DonnaBella
- Brute Thug w/Mace
- Running Thief
- Backup Thug #1
- Backup Thug #2

Rune grabs the Brute and unleashes the witchbolt upon the thug.
He hits with a 19 for 2 damage.
He then swings his sword and hitt for 6 physical damage.

The Brute Thug swings the mace at Rune and misses, he swings again and misses.

Morthos throws a fire bolt but misses, singing lines of laundry.
She ducks under but does not get harmed.
Morthos catches up to her but cannot take another action.

The Running Thief climbs a vertical balcony up one and jumpos across to the opposite side vertically above (20 feet). and draws her longbow, firing a bolt into Morthos' shoulder for 4 damage.

Morthos points his finger at her and casts Hellish Rebuke, hitting her for 10 damage. As the Thief is drawing her bow back for a second shot she bursts into ash... dropping the back of holding.

Morthos reaches out and catches the bag of holding.

Donnabella sees Morthos is doing okay, and turns back to the Thug and Rune.
She casts Cloud of Daggers on the Thug, slashing him for 13 damage...

Rune uses a two handed attack for 8 damage. The Thugs is almost down.
Rune readies himself for another attack.

The Thug screams "Come on then, have it now!"
Two more bandints enter the fray from the doorway behind where we entered the street.
He then flails at Rune, missing entirely for both his swings.
Donnabellas daggers slice across his face and drop him dead.

Morthos steps back into the street from the alley (15 feet) and sees the two thugs approaching behind rune.
He hits one for 2 wiht Fire Bolt and draws his shortbow.

Donnabella keeps the dagger cloud alive in place.

The are about 9 feet away from Rune.
They close in and pull their close range weaponse.

B.Thug #1 uses a scimitar and misses.
B.Thug #2 also misses.

Rune chops at the singed Thugs neck...
He misses and steps a few feet away....

Morthos uses Sneak Attack and drops the B.Thug #2 with 20 damage.

DonnaBella sighs and drops concentration on the dagger cloud, walking toward the thug. She stops 15 feet short of them and casts eldritch blast.

She hits him but he is not dropped yet.

The Bandit turns and runs.

Rune throws his sword at the Thief but fails and the thief keeps running.

Morthos shoots him with Sneak Attack using his shortbow, hitting with 23 and causing 19 damage.

Corpses:

- Thug Brute
- Running Thief
- B.Thief #1
- B.Thief #2

Morhtos checks out the burnt corpse. Most of it is burnt or blown away, but there is some coin.  
8 GP
16 SP

The Bandits both had a scimitar, light crossbow (one damaged).
The Brute has a mace. It seems nice.
d6 + 2
Heavy Crossbow 1d10
Leather Armor (dmgd)
Coins:
12 GP
10 SP

We throw all these weapons in the bag of holding.
Morthos takes the Heavy Crossbow.

Nothing appears damaged or missing from the bag of holding.

We will return to the Inn of a Thousand faces and heal.
We are all going to bump to Level 5 now!!!

Thorune Fighter +5 - Dual Attack

We sleep it out at the Inn of a Thousand faces.
Starting out early to catch a ride with Rance.

We catch up with Rance early on and grab a ride back towards Phandolin.
An uneventful ride back to Fandolin, arriving about 9pm.

We decide to rest for the night in town.
We will go see Harbin in the mornign and resolve our paperwork.

Harbin reviews the deeds for the grounds and offers to assist in repairs and workers.

We give him the papers from his brother.
He is relievd he is alive but is worried about hiring workers for the camp.

He pays us our 100 GP.
Asks where we are going next?

We tell him that we are going to got o the Gold mine.
We tell him we will get a wagin north of town.
Harbin says Raskin will meet us there so we can accompany him.

We head north to the town stables to rent a wagon and a horse.
The kid running the operation, Randy, says he can rent a wagon for 1 SP per day.

Another kid shows up with a horse.
Randy says they charge 10 GP for the horse.

Morthos fails to throw a persuasion check and fails twice.
Rolls a 2 on each. with +6 that is still just 8).

We agree to buy the beautiful horse and cart for 10 GP.

- A mare, species TBD.
- Strong for farm work but lively and can run.

We will name her Epona (Goddess of horses and breeding).

We spend a few minutes adjusting to the wagona and Epona.
We can tell not to open it up, the wagon would fall apart.
Epona is powerful.

After a moment we see a VERY large man in suspenders and overalls approach.
He says "Are you Harbin's fella's?"
MC: "Yes we are! You Don John?"
DJ: "Yes I am. We ready to go?"
MC: "Yes we are. Load up."

We begin to ride out...

DJ says he thinks its rediculous he hired us.
There is nothing tha he is afrid of.
He grew up on NW woods and is unafraoid.
He begins to regail us with tales of how he wa a whaler and a gold miner.
He was a nice pirate.
He says he spent years doing what he loves (mining, pirating, whaling, land living) and now he is here to get the Gold Mine on track.

We make good time, and begin to look fro an exit path to the Gold Mine.
We peel off onto a less used trail.
DJ beings to perk up.
MC: "You worried DJ?"
DJ: "Shh... " (waves us quiet)

High grass on either side reveals two paths flanking the cart left and right.
We see 4 creatures approaching quickly and prepare for engagement.

COMBAT ORDER:

- Donnabella (back left (14)
- Morthos (front left) (9)
- Don John (back right) (3)
- Thorune (front right) (2)

MONSTERS:

- BEAST 1: WereJackal (15+) - Left of Wagon
- BEAST 2: WereJackal (15+) - Far Left of Wagon
- BEAST 3: WereJackal (8) - Right of Wagon
- BEAST 4: WereJackal (8) - Far Right of Wagon

The two creatures on the left rear up and howl in fury, launching forwrd in an attack at the front left of the wagon (Morthos).

First (Far Left) hits with 14, but MC uses uncanny dodge to take 2 damage.
The second (Left) bites MCs left forearmm for 4 damage.

DB uses Eldritch Blast with her left hand while clutching her magic ribbon with her right hand, but missed.

MC uses Fire Bolt and hist the biting WereJackal for 5 damage.

The second group of WereJackals lunge at Thorune.
The first (Right) misses (with a 11), the second (Far Right) also misses (with a 14).

DJ lashes out at the nearest unarmed, but misses.
He punchs with his second fist (right) and smashes the beast (farthest right) across the muzzle for 14 damage - significantly bloodied.

Thorune grabs the beast closest too him and attempts to grapple the beast into the cart so Morthos can slit its throat with its dagger.
Rune punches it in the throat twice, hitting with a 14 for 5 damage.

The FL WJ attack MC again, hitting with a 22 for 5 damage.
MC uses Hellish rebuke as a reaction, hitting for 8 damage (-13 total).

DOnnabella uses EldritchBlast on te Far Left and hits for 5 damage.

Morthos uses advantage and sneak attack to stab the werejackal thorune is holding in the neck with is dagger, exploding its arteries for 18 damage, killing the beast.

The far right WereJackal attacks again.
He misses?

DJ attacks, hitting

Far left WereJackal hits MC for 5.
MC uses Hellish Rebuke hitting for 10 damage (-15 total).

DB uses her quarterstaff to bash the last one in the head for 5 damage, dropping it dead out of the wagon.

We loot the bodies and find 12 GP.
Thorune takes a sharp canine from their bodies.,
For the shrine at Fandolin.

We head back on our way.

We come across the remains of 6 orcs, frozen to death in a huddled bunch.

It looks like a White Dragon did this, DJ says.

We loot the bodies.
Most are clad in leather armor with primitive weapons.
One is slighter in build, taller, with more decoration and has a staff, could maybe be a spell caster.
They have a staff and a rune necklace, likely tribal.

The necklace rock lights up, but no clear school of magic - more like a focus stone.

Morthos takes the necklace and puts it on.

- MC can attune to the item next he takes a short rest if he wants to avoid needing small items (non consumable) for spells and casting.

We press on again and approach the mine.

We see a tunnel burrowing itno teh mountainside, a wooden plank above bearng the words "Mountains Toe" emblazoned in dark relief.

We pull up out front and park our wagon.

It is approximately 3pm in tha afternoon.

DJ says he has no map of the mine, but not much to go on.

We take a sort rest and MC gains back 5 HP from 1 hit dice.

We approach the cave entrance and see two armed wererats standing guard.

MC uses Disguise Self to look like a rat guard.
MC casts comprehend languages on self.
MC uses deception checm with advantage to ask where the boss is.
They ask if I am NeverWinter.I say yes, New.
He says, go in, go straight, go left, then turn a little bit.
MC enter sthe cave some and looks around.
One of them commands the other to show me the way.
MC accepts tha offer to be leadd through the caves.
The guard leads MC into the tunnels.
The guard gets confused hiumself but sniffs his way through the tunnels.
It is a well maintained and trodden tunnel, but its layout is haphazard.
MC uses stealth to quietly transmit his path turns and paces to Rune via the sending stones.
The rat guard approaches the door and knocks, then opens the door and rushes in.
He rushes to the center of them and the four giant rats inside begin approaching me.
They may smell me.
They are looking at me like they know.Time to fight.

Morthos asks if anyone can speak Common tongue.
The Rat guard says he does.
MC asks where the miners are?
Rat guard says "We miners!"
MC "What happened the the people who were here?"
RG "We take mine!"
Morthos slams the door sut and braces it with his crowbar, then runs down the tunnel.

He makes it to the door before the beats escape from the room.
MC stealth checks coming out the mine door (25) and sneak attacks the Rat Guard from behind with advantage,
driving a dagger through his skull for 19 damage.
The Rat Guard took another staggering turn and got smashed in teh skull by DJs massive fist for 12 damage, falling down in a twitching heap.

We setup a chokepoint at the exit to the Mine.

COMBAT ORDER:

MC
RUNE
DB
JD

First giant rat comes through and MC fireworks.Hist with advantage and crossbow +1 with sneak attack for 13 damage, killing the rat.

Second rat comes through, with half cover, but woithdraws back in again.

DB waits...

Rune waits his turn as well to maintain element of surprise.

DJ approaches the southern door and opens it.
He says "nothing here, just lumber and materials"...

The litte rats move...

MC enters the southern door with DJ.
He sees the materials and a tunnel curving south out of the chamber.
He holds position, ow ready.

DB yells to Rune "WHat do you want to do?"
Rune says "I will gaurd this door and our flank, you follow MC."
DB enters the southern door enough to see the room and MC but not too far to be useful to Rune as well should the need arise.

Rune holds his action again, guarding the doors.

DJ, moves from behind MC down the southern tunnel, revealing a door leading West and the tunnel continuing south and bending down to the east.

The little rats move... but hold by the door.

MC moves down the southern tunnel, coming round the corner to face a Giant Rat!!

The GR smelled me coming, and jumps 7 feet onto my right arm and bites for 3 damage, but MC casts Hellish Rebuke in reaction and hits for 7 damage, cooking the beast in its own wretched juices.

The WereRat Guard jumps at MC from down the tunnel, attacking but missing.
He gets a second attack, using a short sword, and misses with that too.

Another wererat, the other fenale fro the room I think, comes from around the corner and attacks MC with a crossbow, hitting eith a 19 for 6 damage.

Rune kicks in the door and Witchbolts one of the rats, disintegrating it.

The second giant rat ran back up the tunnel in fear.

DJ come lunging down teh tunnel to punch a smashing right hook on the wererat engaged with MC, crunching it for 16 damage.
He follows up with a mighty left, bludgeoning the wererat for 13 damage.

MC attacks with his daggers, having advantage, decapitating the Wererat with a double cutting motion for 10 damage.

DB moves down the southern tunnel and holds her action.

Thorune uses the sending stone to tell us he is pursuing the rat.
He chases it north into the tunnel MC was originally led through.

He slices it apart with his short sword.
The rat falls into a cleanly minced pile of dead meat.
THorune wipes his sword across the corpse to clesn it, making it amost as dirty as before.

DJ runs east down the bottom tunnel and waits.

MC tells Rune he is following DJ and the last were rat and heads east as well into the tunnel. He holds position, seeing the wererat down the tunnel behind cover.

WereRat Female runs back back into the main chamber she was first in.

DB enters the door to the West in teh southern tunnel, it is filled to the brim with crates and casks. She closes the door and follows MC down the tunnel.

Thorune follows the corridor going northward to a small antechamber filled with casks of unidentified liquid. He then returns back to the intersection of the tunnnels and looks around.

In the northern antechamber with a door facing the east.
Thorune hold his position.

DJ looks back for DB, calls out to check.
"I'm here she says!"
"Okay" and continues down the corridor, following the wererat female into teh large central chamber, seeing her run towards a doorway that enters into another eastern facing tunnel on the main internal chamber.

Digression and exhaustion overtake the party IRL... we stop for the week.

```
 DJ turns to look at MC, indicating that he is concerned about the wound he reciewved and maybe knows what it means.
 MC asks him "How fuct are you? How long?"
 DJ replies "Don't know for sure, but pretty well fuct."
 MC "Then lets make it count for something, eh?"
 DJ nods and runs ahead after the WR.
```

- DJ: disappears around the tunnel bend and we hear scuffling.
- TH: Continues to follow the path winding deeper Easteward into the cave system.
- WR: Runs away around the bend in the tunnel.
- DB: Runs forwarx into the hallway and cast aArmour of Agathus, surrounding her boy in a swirling icy mist taht hardens into covering armour.
- MC: Runs forward into the tunnel and bangs into the closing walls, the tunnel splits again Eastward and spirals further into the North-West where DJ and the WR are near one another. Morthos hurls one of his daggers and misses, sending it clanging along the floor, thankfullly also missing DJ.
- XP: Explores the room he is in, seeking information about what is in the sacks, books and crates in the room.

- DJ: Runs around the corner after WR, you hear strange noises and DJ comes backing down corridor towards MC again, then stands ground in a defensive posture.
- TH: Sees that the path splits again, continuin East and also heading South. TH heads south as far as he can, seeing what appears to ba a descending stairwell up ahead.
- WR: We do not know what is happenig around the corner past DJ... Ahead of DJ we can hear scurrying, scratching sound - like a Rat climbing up or past something. We hear a scratchy and clickety sounds, like many little legs.
- DB: Calls out to MC "Keep your eye on that noise, I am going to check out the side passage an dmake sure we aren't cut off." She calls back, "I see a stairwell up and a path South in the chamber behind us." then she turns to face the corridor where DJ is and freezes, muttering "Ohhh Fuck."
- MC: Tells DB to cover him and calls out to DJ "On your six".... He sees no WR anymore, but clinging to the corner is a giant gelatinous termite pushing down into the mineshaft. All he can see if the front of this enormous thing, butthe WR is not to be seen. It seems to be mindlessly searching for a scent to pursue as it digs into the mineshaft from outside. Morthos casts Poison Spray but the acidic mess splashes against the wall next to the creature, missing it. MC takes a defensive posture and prepares to counter the beats.
- XP: Follows the sights and sounds of scuffles and begins to approach the Eastward facing tunnel the WR ran into.

```
DJ: Looks at MC, says "I don't want to punch that. Got a weapon?"
MC: "There's a dagger on over there!"
DJ: Finds the dagger and throws it at the reatrure, hitting it for 3 points of damage.

The creature continues to ooze into the room, it is only a few feet away from MC. DJ backs up a few feet from the beast.
```

- TH: Runs down the stairwell and sees DB's shoulder sticking out from a corridor.
- WR: The wererats leg drops from between the wall and the beast and falls before MC. The leg looks to be ripped off from friction.
- DB: Says to TH "There is something big up there." TH nods agreement. DB steps forward and sees the Carrion Crawler writhing ahead. She grips her magic bookmark totem and casts cloud of daggers at the creatures face, ahead of where it is slithering forward, creating a barrier of death between the beast and MC and DJ.
- MC: Casts Fire Bolt so badly, that it falls at his feet and he takes 1 damage himself.
- XP: Runs up behind group at last and says hi.

- DJ: Punches the creature for critical damage, sending cracks across its crapice, screeches emanating from its many-toothed mouths as it begins to flail trying to turn arouynd - a task its huge body is not designed for.
- TH: Comes running up the corridor and is taken aback by the little Half-Elf Ranger.

```
XP: "What's up?"
TH: "Killing Monsters."
XP: "Can I join?"
TH: Nods and points ahead continuing on his path to destroy the monster.
```

TH: Charges forward, shoving everyone aside and bracing to Cast his THUnder Belch - and hits for 5 damage with a meager fizzling attack, thinking he has failed to hit. The creature slides forward out of the hole in the ceiling, its oozing body so large it shoves the party back into the hallway as it smashes to the floor.

DB: chuckles "That is one biiig banana slug. So," turning to XP, "whose this guy?"
XP: "I was looking for hides ot sell at the local village, curious about the sounds from the cave. It seemed interesting and so I followed the trail."
DJ: "What was that thing?" he ask raggedly, clutching his shredded arm, the knuckles of his right hand blistered from contact with the sluglike monsters toxic surface.

Everyone tries to identify it but no one knows for certain.
We realize it is decomposing and toxins are seeping forth from the rapidly decomposing corpse.
The party withdraws down the hallway to a safer area and makes more formal introductions to one another.

IRL:

Discussion among the group about the nature of what DnD is like. Agreement that it is very much a collaborative form of realtime dynamic storytelling where the DM is the lead author but opayers have compete agency to contrl their characters, thus establishing an organic and unpredictable storyline or narrative. When the DM embraces freedom of choice and is not controlling, the dice answer the questions of "if" it happened so the DM can focus on enabling the players imagination rather than directing the action (though that can be done). The players can challenge one another with their imagination and continue to evolve the character's relationship, extending the lore and the mythology of the world in an improvisational manner. Compared metaphorically to doing collaborative quantum computing, where each player is a measure of state that the players deterministically manifest like a human qubit. The game "content", being ephemeral and existing purely in the mind, can be generated endlessly to fit the needs of the player's style, storyline, and even uniquely specific queries or actions. Nothing is limited, every visit back to a location or interaction with a character will yield unique experiences and new information, a quality that cannot be replicated at this level by any physical construct. There is no end to the game unless the players decide there is an end... and even that is still based on their decision to remain "ended".

Next Game: estimated 12/26 (day after Xmas Day).

We position ourselves to best defend against the unseen enemy.
Morthos sneaks around the southern corner to find a single wererat in a long hallway leading east.
The wererat reacts with surprise, momentarilly too shocked to respond.
Morthos fires his crossbow at the wererat, hitting him for 2 damage in the leg.

Need to deal with the Lycanthropy within 3 days by high level priest!!

**NOTE 2**

https://roll20.net/compendium/pathfinder/Lycanthrope#content

Lycanthrope

Creating a Lycanthrope

“Lycanthrope” is an inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted lycanthropes) template that can be added to any Humanoid.

Challenge Rating: Same as base Creature or base Animal (whichever is higher) + 1.

Size and Type: The Creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) gains the Shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of some type of Animal (referred to hereafter as the base animal) within one size category of the base creature's size. A lycanthrope's hybrid form is the same size as the base Animal or the base Creature, whichever is larger.

AC: In hybrid or Animal form the lycanthrope has the natural armor bonus of the base Animal increased by +2.

Defensive Abilities: A natural lycanthrope gains DR 10/silver in Animal or hybrid form. An afflicted lycanthrope gains DR 5/silver in Animal or hybrid form.

Speed: Same as the base Creature or base Animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.

Melee: A lycanthrope gains Natural Attacks in Animal and hybrid forms according to the base Animal.

Special Attacks: A lycanthrope retains all the Special Attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base Creature. In hybrid or Animal form it gains the Special Attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base Animal. A lycanthrope also gains Low-Light Vision, scent, and the following:

Ability Scores: +2 Wis, –2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con in hybrid and Animal forms. Lycanthropes have enhanced senses but are not fully in control of their emotions and animalistic urges. In addition to these adjustments to the base creature's stats, a lycanthrope's ability scores change when he assumes hybrid or Animal form. In human form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are unchanged from the base creature's form. In Animal and hybrid form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base animal's, whichever Ability Score is higher.
Lycanthropy

A Creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain any of the template's adjustments or abilities) until the night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes Animal form and forgets his or her own identity. The character remains in Animal form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in which case he becomes aware of his condition.

A Remove Disease or heal spell cast by a Cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of wolfsbane (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an afflicted lycanthrope a new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.

### DAY 13 (2021.01.23)

_Note: Tapper fixed up Isaias' character_

Resuming our journey... tick tick tick... 2 day, 14 hours.

Morthos reveals that he had a vision in his dreams and is going ot remain a wererat.
The Great Horned Rat came to him, Grimstank, and showed him a vision of himself in the future.
He will become a summoner of the rat hordes...

DonJohn wants to find a cure for himself still.
Everyone leans into finding a cure.

Morthos finds a small leathery puch in the main room the wererat woman was in at first.
It contains a scroll, in broken language, seemingly to speak about the small vial of pearlescent green liquid in the bag as well.
She refers to it as a "security blanket, back door escape from curse"
Concoction of wolfsbane.

MC (INT check - 15)
-- something to be ingested.
-- single dose.
-- seems to be related to lycnthropy.

DJ has followed Morthos.
Morthos offers the vial to DJ.
Donnabella indicates she thinks its legit.
DJ asks if its okay.
MC says its probably safe.
DJ drinks it, biut no immediate effect.
As he walks to DB he fallsto his knees in a spasm.
He rolls and jerks across th eflorr, then slumps.
After town mihutes he regains composure.
He appears to be better, healthier.
Like he broke a fever.

We assume DJ is cured at this point.

We still have not found the over seer's office.
That is where we need to go.

Thorune wants to know about the lycanthropy curse MC is keeping.
BD describes Lycanthropy in greater details.

- It varies by variation of creature (wolf, bear, rats, etc.)
- some are aggressive, others are cooperative, others are clan-like, others are solitary
- there can be immunities as well

Morthos heads to te North-Western door to see what is up there.
DB follows MC.
TH brings up the rear with DJ.
It is a bunk hose with a dozen cots or so.
Some perosnal belongings but nothig of great value.

MC and DB go to te NorthEast door behind the carrion crawler corpses.
It opens to the Overseers office.
The office has been ransacked thoroughly.
Cot, chair, desk, empty wooden chest.

MC asks DJ if there was somethign they were supposed to be expecting to find.
DJ says there were keys for all the mie doors and also some recent blueprints and schematics of the mine.
There have been new shafts added he does not know about.
Some money would also have been nice.
This was under the oversight of te dwarf.
DJ thinks his clan ran the show and some local townfolks.

XZ asks if thare are signs of a struggle.Nope.
DJ says there is nothing hidden to look for that he knows of.

We go to the last tunnel and head north first, MC enters a deadend wjhere 5 giant rats confront him.
The party runs up behind him.
Morthos yells "Hey Rune, I think I found a ogood time for yo to use your Blasting Horn!"

We examine the room and see rat meat piles.
MC explores a rats nests and find the following:

- 7 SP
- 1 GP
- Spool bloody hair

DB explores a nest and finds:

- 1 Opal
- some coppers (DB kicks a rats corps in frustration "Coppers...")

We go to the Northernmost door.
XP listens but hears nothing.
Rune listens but hears nothing.
MC listens and hears voices bickering to be quiet.
MC tries to pick the lock and fails.

The party knocks and says "Hello?"
"What are you doing in there?"

**silence**

Two dwarves peek around the corner below us and then run back in the door again.
More bickering inside.

"No they arent rats,"
"but Ithough they were rats?"
"well they aren't"

The door opens and reveals five ragged and beaten dwarves (DW), exhausted and wild eyed with anxiety.
They ask for water.
We provide drinks and snacks.

MC: "How long has it been this wya?"
DW: "Weeks at least, we were overrun and ran of water days ago. Did you find any other dwarves?"
MC: "Two"
XP: "How big was your contingent?"
DW: "There should have been a dozen..."
MC: "There were several large carrion crawlers..."
DW: _shocked_ "I told you I heard them out there... in the dark."
DJ: "Where is the overseer?"
DW: "We havent seen him since this began."
DJ: "Do you know of keys or mine maps?"
DW: "Nope, all in Overseers office."

We return to the hole in the ceiling to look for any clues.
MC looks inside, there is a tunnel like an earthworm.
Inside there are bones and fragments strewn about.
There are pieces strewn about.
It would take some time to explore the network of caves.

MC asks about the tunnel opening to the outside in the NorthEast.
There is a burial ground outside.
It is sacred and we should not mess with it at this time.

DJ thanks us for our help and wants to give us a reward but has nothing to give other than his thanks.
Offers for us to come back and chack in at any later time.
We might see him in Fandolin.

#### Return to Fandolin

We load back up in the wagon and head for Fandolin.
It takes about 7 hours to return to toen, we have no encounters.
Rolling into Fandolin the sun is setting.
We see in the town on the green there are some new wagons, new arrivals setting up camp.
Looks to be some kind of a merkt like arrangement.
One of the merchants hails us.
MC asks how long they are in town.
Merchant says a few days.
MC asks "In the morning?"
Merchant: "Yes!"
MC "See you then."

We continue onto Harbins.
He anticipates our arrival and opens his peephole.
MC describes the trip to him.
Harbin says thanks.
He pays us:
-- 100 GP
-- 1 SP (for our troubles)
