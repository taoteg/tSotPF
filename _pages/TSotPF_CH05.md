### DAY 23A (2022.04.24)

Fresh and rested, we begin our adventuriong anew after upgrading our wares and restoring our stocks.

We seek the Black Light of Tyr for information about the beasts we have encountered in the dungeons. We fgo to the northwest, passing through hovels and back alleys, near ruinous in their decay, until we come to the Black Light. Ot is one of few decent buildings visible.

As we enter the store, we see statues and amour and goods, some maybe not moved in a long time. There is enough space for maybe 10 men before a long counter splits the room. Neyond the counter, piled to the ceiling, is a maze of semi-organize, or perhaps somewhoat chatoc, stacks of goods and wares of every description.

Orden, the shop keep appears, a gnomish man, muttering to himself and lost in inspection, unaware of our presence. He is moving among the paths through the goods, his pantaloons cropped at he wait and a glorious blonde afro suspending outward from his head.

Thorune approaches him and speaks, startling the gnome.

TH: "Sorry to startle you, we came seeking information abotu some creatures we encountered."
OR: "Information is all I've got. Tell me morew about your creature."

We describe the creatures (Chicken Man and Bat thing)
We descirbe the 3 FUBS == Greck, which is a local for demon types.

Chicken Man == Vrock
Bat Thing == Shadow Demon
FUBS == Greck

OR: "Where did you encounter this?"
MC: "The sewars, not far from here."
His eyes grow wide and he is startled.
OR: "And did anyone else know about this?"
MC: "The workers know of it, though they hide and run when they appear."
OR: "For how long have they known?"
MC: "It seems for some time, though growing worse of late."
...The party formally introduces itself...
MC: "How bad is this, these creatures?"
OR: "These forces do not belong in our world. Many folk think of them as fairy tales, but I know better."
XP: "Is there a portal nearby or smething?"
OR: "I am thinking yes, maybe, or a tear between dimensions - like a stack of pancakes or nested layers. These things are terrible creatures and their presence bodes ill."
XP: "Did someone send them here?"
OD scurries about and pulls out several books rto show uis.
"Therse are grunts, garden variety creatures in the demon world. Your floaty brain chiocken tentcle tings are underlings at best. How they got here is one thing, btu why they have been sent here is another, and to what end?" His eyes glaze as he considers the possibilities...
TH: "Is there a way to send these demons back whence they came?"
D: "In general, most texts suggest marchall fighters use silver, or have your weapons silvered, maybe blessed as well for a little extra." He eyes the group seriously. "This is not your schoolyard fairy tail creatures, you need to take this seriously. Rivers of information across eons of time have nted towards these creatures, and none of it is good for life in our plane."
XP: "Where can we seek more information?"
OR: "The library up the street can help there if you want to research. I am glad to help but I am also a business man, so if you can make it worth my vaue that will help as well."
TH: "Forgive me wee afroman, but what are the cliff notes?"
OR: "Like I said, unless specific case, Silver tipped, made of silver, enchantedn and blessed."
XP: Throws 1 CP and 1 SP, OR catches the SP.
OR: "Did you have further questions MC?"
MC: "Yes, do you have anything that can help combat, neutralize, battle or communicte with demons in any way? An object, talisman, rune, spell, anything?"
OR thinks and begins to scribble down something on paper.
"Tell you what, I am going to inventory some things but tlet me tell you, I dont hsve armour or daggers and such, but I _might_ have some scrolls, or talismans or curious of jewelry to look through. Any way to narry this down?"
MC: "Any thing that can impact demons from a buffing perspective.
OR: :"Might I ask, who sent you to me?"
MC: "Arleth from House of a 1000 Faces."
OR gets excioted "Ahh, the 10000 faces, so you know Lady Leal then?"
TH: "Yes we do."
OR: "She can acquire other and differing assistance for you, things that you cannot find here. Alchemy, imbuing, buffing and booning your equipment. Everything has a price and requires time, but if you know what you need, then you can seek it out."
He begins to turn away... "Oh, and dont lead ANYONE here! But I will begin looking for some finds for you."
He squints at XP and MC...

MC: Verifies Weapons:

- Vampiric Fine Daggers
- +1 ATTACK/DAMAGE rolls
- Once per short rest, with notification of DM that you are doing it, upon making a succesful ATTACK, you can take half the DAMAGE as HEALTH.

We go to the Northside Blacksmith and ask abot silvering our weapons.

MC: Vampiric Fine Daggers = 350 GP per Dagger (700 GP total)
DB: 10 Bolts with Silver Tips (@25 GP/ea) (250 GP total)

We pay our 1000 GP and take our upgraded weapons and bolts.
We head to the Shrine at the EAST side of town and see out an entrance.
It is clearly visited by people, candles and figures, beads and flowers litter the grounds.
Small vials of liquor and offerings sit about haphazardly. It is not well taken carte of, the age of itas stones showing a decrepit fice. There is no obvious stariwell within, some daylight penetrating holesin the ancient walls, the edificice pourpous and vine covered. Cracked floor time reveal nothing to us.

We INVESTIGATE, but everyone fumbles about poorly. Evenbtully DB triggers a latch that slides the pedestal central to the shrine aside 18", revealing atight and dark passageway into darkness below.

TH looks into the stairwell (PERCEPTION 20!), seeing runes marked onto the walls, a code that MC recognizes as Thieves Cant. MC reads the inscriptions. Some are general and some are explcit directions for smugling routes in the city. Some also refer to bogeyman reatures from myths and legends. Some scratches have been removed, by time and by the hands of others.

The party descends down the tight tunnels that empties into a sewer tunnel, 4 x 4' wide culvert, heading away o the west from the steps into a larger part of the sewar. The culvert parallels the river that splits NW in half.

We begin to creep forward slowly, some subtle light creeping in from the distance. The pathway continues straight but there are doors at the right and left.

We are walking single file: TH, MC, DB, XP

As we approach the intersection, TH feels its clear, but upon turning to update the group he thinks he hears a baby cry - far in the distance. It triggers a distant childhood memory.

TH: Did you hear that? The baby cry?

We did not.
MC sends Fenster down the rightmost tunnel.
It splits Left -- Right.
He goes right and encounters ROUSs eating another ROUS like animal.
He backs out carefully and explores the other side (the left), but finds nothing after about 70'. MC recalls Fenster and the group begnis cautiously moving forward.

We are about 6 feet below sea level now, passing opatch work repaitrs on the tunnels wlls.
We eventually come to a larger tunnel and it allows us to stand, the roof beign 7-8'.
We feel les soppressed, small beams of sunlight breaking in from above.
There are little hallways ahead, some bricked up, some barricked and covered with debris and rubble. Further down there are three more tunnels, abour 20 feet apart, that open up to the right. The left side seems to be mostly blocked, these tunnels face towards the river south of us. The open tunnels run away to the North.

TH gets the sensation he heard someone call his name, a faint hint of sensation.
XP also senses a distant sound, almost too faint to hear.
XP asks TH "Do you hear a baby?"
TH "Yes."
MC: "DB, are there any creatures that cry like a child?"
DB: "Not off hand, usually the monster takes the babies."

We proceed cautiously, past the first tunnel and nothing happens.
As we approich teh second, the tunnel before us dips down and grows darker.
It is clearly a wild hole with root systems and insects crawling about,
We proceed forwards cautiously, approaching the oopenign space.
MC summons Fenbster again, and he crawls up upon the edge ofa rotunde looking over a massive keep that domes above is 25-40 feet, but the bottom is hardly visible.

MC sends Fenster out flying to examine the topology of the space.
As he rounds the dark cylinder in the center, he observes other tunnels connecting in many places. We can hear shrieks and sounds of animals all over below us, like an ocean of monstrous fates. We see only small rodents, but the sounds of the cavernous space indicate we are not the only predators about.

Fenster begins to circle down, descending into the lower space, struggling to get a better look around some of the columns, exposing culverts and hallways that just into the distance from all over. ABout 4-5 levels deep, he bumped somethign that decided to respond and suddenyl went dark.

We decide that this nexus is too deep too commit to exploring right now. We return to the main tunnel again and decide to examine the 3rd tunnel we had seen.

As we enter it, it is the same general beginning, but descends lower and curves back towards the previous area, the sounds of the chitenous beasts trickling back through the decayed hallways of the ageless panopticon.

XP turns back to look behind us, his hunters senses tingling, but sees nothing.
He turnns back to folow the party and a huge thick gooey rope descends, it leathery blackness attempting ot wrap around his neck and strangle him.

### DAY 23B (2022.05.07)

We resume from the end of combat of last week.

- DB casts cure wounds on XP for 11 HP.
- TH uses a Greater Potion of Healing for

DB - 47 HP
XP - 36 HP
TH - 49 HP
MC - 66 HP

We examine the panopticon space before us. It is massive, built by some ancient race that is long forgotten. The design and effort is beyond the comprehension of most folks, layers of city built upon the bones of a forgotten time.

We decide to examine the hallway to the right.
XP perception checks (18) and looks ahead.
Mostly there are empty alcoves and rubble in vaed doorways.
Eventually we con to a branching path that breaks free from the main path at a slight angle.
We see no signs of glyphs or symnbols, but there is unusual wear on the stones (like scratches).

MC summons Fenster as a bat, takes hold of TH and DB shoulders, and explores the main tunnel.
We see more doorways, every 30-60 feet there are alcove with different stone on the openings.
There are two on the right, several obstructions on the left.
He comes upon a metal grate over a smaller sewer tunnel.
Beyond it is a larger room, like a holding reservoir for multiple sewars to deposit flow into, like a wet garbage dump.
Fenster returns and we send him down the other hallway.
It is like a large circular tunnel, on the left there are similar culvert rooms (like were on the right in the other hallway).
On the right, there are 2 darkened hallways, rough hewn and jutting away at sharp angles.
MC hears a cry via Fenster, the cry of a child.
DB hears it as well.
XP also hears it.
The group becomes very alert, ready for action.
MC sends Fenster further down the circular tunnel, passing more antechambers on the left.
He comes to a bocked passage on the right after 50 feet, and to the left he sees another reservoir type intersection.
It could be the same room, but it is unclear.
Ahead of Fenster there is light coming from a hallway on the left at the end of his range.

Party order still TH, MC, DB, XP.
TH is still illuminating the corridor with his sword for about 30 feet.
The corridor looks bored out and cavelike, as if something dug it out.
As we approach, light from TH sword spills into the tunnel and the scream of the baby cries out.

MC summons Fenster again as a cat, sending him cautiously into teh cave entrance.
The corridor opens up in o a semiciorcular room of about 50 square feet.
Within the room there is a ragged, twiggy nest.
In the center of it lies a dirty human baby in rags, its skin is oily and filthy.
It is crying out for help it seems.
Fennster does a Perception check (2) but sees little.
Fenster approaches the nest, which is set aloft on a tree about 3 feet up.
Fenster hops upon the edge and sees the crying, dirty baby.
The baby pauses crying at the sight of him and gurgles in less distress for a moment.
Fenster walks up to teh baby and it simply lays there and goos in response.
Fenster sits next to teh baby and looks around (Perception Check 7).
He determines he came in from the left and the room has another exit to the right.
There are marking along the inner wall.
From below the pedestal there is some candlelight.

Back in the tunnel, TH and DB look around.
The room ahead, where the light is coming from, flickers with some movement.
TH taps MC, drawing him back.
MC: "There's a fucking dirty, oily baby in a giant birds nest down there!"
DB: "What the fuck?"
TH: "There is something moving in the light ahead of us, to the left."
TH: "We need to move, lets grab this baby and get the Phandolin out of here!"

We decide to post DB and XP at the tunnel entrance while TH and MC stealthilly enter to get the baby.
The hallway ahead with the light flickers in movement again, the baby resumes its crying.
XP and DB sees another ripple in the light.
XP readies his bow while DN prepares a spell.
Meanwhile TH and MC enter the other chamber.
MC tries to lift the baby with his Mage Hand and lift it up.
He succeeds in lifting the baby and it calms somewhat.
MC begins to draw the baby towards him,
We instantly hear footsteps running towards us from behind the baby.
Dust reveals rapid movement in our direction.
In the hallway XP and DB see a robed, white haired hooknosed eastern european hag appears.
She has a bowl of something in her hand.
She points her finger at XP and DB.
We roll for initiative.

MC: 21
TH: 18
DB: 11
XP: 9
Russian Green Hag (#1):
Invisible Hag (#2):

## ROUND 1

MC: Uses the Mage Hand to fling the baby the last few feet and catches it, taking a defensive posture and stepping behind TH.

TH: yells out "Damn your eyes!" and lights his sword to full brightness within the space, blinding light filling the room. The creature remains invisible, but it is blinded by the light, a tiny whimper emits but we are unable to determine what this is still.

TH: "Run!"
MC turns to run back out of the hallway.

RGH (#1): reaches towards XP and begins cursing actively, a golden energy wrapping around her arm and extending from her finger tips.

XP rolls a ST (FAIL - 12) giving him DISADVANTAGE on next Attack and 3 Psychic Damage.

IH (#2): Lashes out at MC, the wind of some attack brushing across his back but missing him. In attacking it reveals itself, another Russian Haglike creature that could be a twin of the other.

DB: Finger tuts and shoots radiance of light, illumination shining forth from the ceiling like daggers of light, slicing the RGH for 10 RADIANT DMG.

XP: Attacks with his bow, but rolls NAT 1 and the arrow breaks apart uselessly.

IH (#2): Swings her grubby claws at TH, tearing into him for 13 SLASHING DMG.

RGH (#1): Turns invisible.

XP: Steps back and holds his action for when there os a play.

## ROUND 3

MC: Walks forward to where DB is and attacks the space where the RGH would be, hitting her for 17 DMG.

RGH (#1): Slashes at DB, hitting for 13 SLASHING DMG, but also revealing herself to the party.

IH (#2): TH fails a ST (19!!!), the creature vanishing and instead one of TH elder's stand before him. The face from his dreams, where he almost died, and the face begs him for help. TH is powerless to attack for one round.

## ROUND 4

MC: STabs is VAMPIRIC DAGGERS into RGH (#1) face, impaling her for 13 PIERCING DMG.

RGH (#1): Turns invisible.

IH (#2): The creature leans in towards TH, suddenly its face becomes menacing and it begins to shout and curse in a strange tongue. TH rolls a ST (fails), he is now at DISADVANTAGE for the next round.

DB: IH (#2) SHOCKING DMG for 6.

XP: Defends the baby and holds his action.

## ROUND 5

RGH (#1): Comes behind MC, wrapping her spectral arm around im and ripping at his throat for (7 SLASHING DMG).

IH (#2): Makes a break for the hallway towards the baby. DB misses her attack of opportunity. She moved behind XP and attempts to wrestle the bay away, but XP wins the contest (19 vs 4) and backs away 10 feet from her.

DB: Fires an Eldritch Blast at the IH (#2) but misses.

XP: Pulling free from the hag, turns and fires at the hag (with DISADVANTAGE) and misses.

## ROUND 6

XP: Fires his bow at IH (#2), striking it for 14 DMG.

## ROUND 7

MC: Runs up to IH (#2) and SNEAK ATTACKS, hitting for 13 DMG, ripping her face apart and ending her as he screams "Get away from her you bitch!"

## END COMBAT

We search for loot...!

We find some costume jewelry and baubles, but none of it of any real value.
TH sees a coin sack with:

- 3 black pearls
- a couple of small bones that feel like rock.
- bunches of hair
- amber
- 5 Platinum coins

Looking about the room with the nest, we find a leatherbound book filled with drawings and spells/enchantments. The parchment is covered in blood and mud. DB examines it and says it is of no real value, but it is filled with sacrificial rituals and descriptions of breaking into other dimensions or realms.

We agree to destroy the book, throwing it up into the air and incinerating it.

Now we have a baby...?

### END SESSION

---

### DAY 23D (2022.05.07)

We resume from the end of (yet more) combat from last week.

We have not yet explored the room the visible hag appeared from. The group sees faint sunlight from above, filtering down through the grate from above.

We discuss what to do wit teh baby.

MC: "What if its a mundane baby?"

Casts Detect Magic to see if the baby has any powers.
He sees a bloom cast fading off the walls.
In the hallway, we see little else.
{Stealth check MC - 16 PASS]}
MC stealths up towards the lit room, seeing flickering colors from within.
Within he sees a multitude of colored auras fading.
Whatever magic hold these hags had on their space and belongings is fading away.
MC stares around the room from the doorway and sees a runic outline on the floor where a floor mat would be.
His instincts tell him it is a ward of trap he does not recognize.
It is a shimmering moving color, chromatic surface like oil.
Across the room MC sees the colors of conjuration (yellow) and abjuration (chartreuse) on an alter in teh corner.
There are scooped out surfaces with small braziers burning substances.
DB joins MC and examines teh room from the doorway.
She deduces that the door ward appears to be of a varying state (like the chromatic orb).
MC: "How can we disable it or shut it down? Can we throw the baby through the doorway? Just kidding!"
MC: "Ya'll should stand back..."
MC summons Fenster as a cat and sends him through the doorway.
As he crosses, the colors change - bursting to life and igniting fire bolts that shoot out in all directions.
Fenster is immediately incinerated by the bolts
MC dodges one as it shooots forth from the doorway, just dodging it with his heightened reflexes.
The blinding light momentarilly stuns us, but after a moment the charm appears to have been used up.
TH comes up and asks if we need any help.
XP rejoins the group as well.
MC steps into the room and surveys it, noticing a soft underlight that emanates soothingly from the walls.
The room smells fetid, though the group is adapting.
The room is tight, the furnishings built into the walls.
There are some walking sticks and necklaces, dreamcatcher charms hanging about, and the bench in the corner.
MC approaches te glowing conjuration stack, pulling out pages that have the same hand as the leatherbound book, and similar in contents.
Up top there are severla incense burners with bloodied gooey gem stones and clumps of muck and blood coated on them.
There is more amber, but everything is raw here, of some indeterminate value.
Incense burns, many pieces of dead creatures and parts, all glowing with conjuration magic.
MC asks DB what she thinks, but she is revulsed by the entire situation.
MC: "Are these components only useful for evil magic and spells? Or can they be used for other useful things?'
MC grabs about 11 clustered gooey gemstones.
We backtrack to the nest room and MC looks for magic through the hallway the invisible hag came from.
The floor is mostly cobblestone, but missing tiles are filled with soil, footprints marking the passage of the hags.
There is candlelight within the room beyond, MC does a check to look for traps.
We are spaced 5 feet apart and MC traces his fingers across the wall.
Within about 6 feet he sees a furnished room opening before him.
The hallway continues striaght across, where a greenih-bluish light is visible, like electricity in the space.
There is the sound of hattering murmer, cackling talk.
MC creeps forward, seeing candlelight in the rooms ot the sides with bookshelves appearing.
At first glance they appear more traditional, normal, like tomes instead of a handmade journal.
They appear to be untouched mostly.
The room extends on far and wide, very Vincent Price in design.
We continue to scooby doo walk forward into the space, sneaking forward.
We roll for a dex check, though Morthos stumbles into a room.
The green blue light flares, and a mass of eyes, light and bones come flying down thehalway towards MC.
We roll for initiative!!

## START COMBAT

TH: 20
DB: 16
MC: 15
XP: 14
EYE-BONE-THING: 13

### ROUND 1

EBT has the drop, gets free turn attack.
MC braces for attack and sees tah the creature is a larger than lifesize skull, its lower jaw chattering madly.
Flames fill its eyes as it charges, wreathed in a blue-green gaslike vapor trail that follows it like a body.
The energy joins up with teh head at 15 feet, approaching us but slowing.
The light wraps around the head like a shawl, focusing into a point that shoots towards MC in a gout of piercing flame.
It tears into MC for 10 FIRE DMG then rapidly begins to regenerate the same beam, firing at MC's leg this time and misses.

TH circles around MC and the EBT, slashing at it with his lightning sword with both hands, but swings wide and misses.
He follows through and swings again, hitting it for 9 LIGHTNING DMG, but it discharges the electricity and only takes 5 LIGHTNING DMG.
Invulnerability detected!

DB swings around from behind XP and in midair switches from Thunderwave, for fear of harming the child, to Eldritch blast, targeting the EBT.
She hits it, concentrating eldritch energy into the skull for 15 FORCE DMG, shaking the skull in its track.
MC rolls across the floor and leaps up, slashing at the creature with his daggers.

On his right he sees movement (which seemed to have been on te left first) but continues his attack.
He slices the creatuure for 10 PIERCING DMG (18 DMG - 7 + 11- but it has resistance and takes 4 + 6).

XP steps behind DB and guards the rear of the group, protecting the baby.

The EBT begins to spastically change, its molecular makeup deforming and glitching in and out of position.
It has warded itself in some way magically as it bobs defensively before TH.

### ROUND 2

TH casts MAGIC MISSILE, flying forth from THs fingers and chasing the glitching beast, hitting it for 11 FORXCE DMG, ending the skull.
All of the meaty sauce flies over MC, bathing him in the FlamerSkull's gooey innards.
The beast is destroyed.

## END COMBAT

Morthos glances back to the corner where he saw the movement, but there is nothing visible there now.
There is a wall at the far end of the room with torch sconces lit but the end is visible about 20 feet in.
Portraits are centered on the walls, the paint rubbed or melted away from the faces to distort the identities.
Both walls are ceiling to floor with books, a small private library here to examine given enough time.

The party splots up about the room and begins inspecting it, rolling for perception check.
As a whole, we spend about an hour casing the books and room.
XP and DB examine the North end and sees nothing of note.
The portrait could be an agrarian setting or a vinyard perhaps, but the figrues are mottled beyond their fineries.
The library yields some fine works, many a great volume, but they are too much to move.

TH and MC explore the Southern side of the room. TH is perturbed by the lack of Dragonborn related items.
MC examines the library and sees the value in it, but it is not time to move a collection.
Examining the sconses and portraits, he also sees the disfigurement on the painting.
This subject was more femnine, slender in white silks and jewels, a pearl necklace about their bodice.
The agrarian landscape behind them turns into an urban setting and distant waters beyond, with a landmark or figure also defaced out of recognition.

MC calls over DB and asks them to look at the painting, asking if they recognize the defaced object.
DB, with her expertise in Hsitory, says thi si slikely a couple or a pair of siblings, some duo of male and female.
The areas behind them are a pastiche of the Sword Coast, potentially with the outer walls of an ancient NeverWinter being displayed behind the figures. It reminds her of the place near Rance's secret camping spot, near the dragon mounds.
The disfigured object is near the urban edge of Neverwinter (on the west of the city).

We decide to examine the hallway the skull cam from. The shape of the tunnel becomes more ovoid as we enter a space at the end.
A basin or small well, grated at 4 or so feet tall, sits in the room.
On painted linen around the room, are other scenes like the portraits from the outer rooms.
Different style, but not much else.

The well in the center opens up and gets deeper, revealing some sort of hand holds down into the darkness, very small and precarious.
The well opens up below to about 5 feet wide, beyond the range of the dark vision at 60 feet... who knows where it ends - or if it does.
The room is otherwise an enclosed chamber with painted panels decorating the walls.
The grate atop the well is solidly attached and does not remove with a strong tug.

This looks like a fine spot for a camp. We prepare to make a short rest here to recover and strategize what to do with a greasy baby.

---

### DAY 23E (2022.07.09)

Morthos sends Fentser down the well as a Spider to see how deep it goes.
There are protruding stones that are about 8-12" wide, spaced about 12-16' apart, seemingly more functional than for any kind of climbing.
At 75 feet it still seems the same, an upward gust begins to push against fenster.
He gets pushed against the wall and has to reatach his thread ot a stone.
As he descends further, the gusting winds increase until he reaches the end of his tether to Morthos.
He sees nothing different below.
Morthos recalls him to the pocket dimension and we move on.

We travel back to the Inn, relatively uninterrupted as we backtrack.
We arrive back at the Inn of 1000 Faces, and see Arleth at the bar working.
Xanku asks if Leyal is around, Arlef points to the steps and we turn to see her descending.
She approaches the party, almost as if she knows we have something for her.
She gently slips the baby from Xanku's oily harness.
She comforts the child and inspects it, then looks upward - as if into space.
A moment later, two similarly robed creatures descend the steps,
one human and one who is mauve colored skin, without hair and with dragonborne features.

Leyal gives the baby over to the two women who attend to it and leave the group.
"I am assuming you want to put this baby into safe care?"
We agree and she informs us the baby will be placed into safe care.
"How did you come about this baby?"
We explain where and how we found it.
She asks about some of the details, ut cannot tel us much withuot seeing the books we burned.
Leyal suspects that it was a conjuration method.
She asks us what ways we dispatched the hags.
We recount that we mostly used force, but some fire and magic missile as well.

We ask if there is anything else we should know.
Leyal explains that there is a tide fo war most are not aware of.
As green adventurers, she implies that as above so below exist labyrinthian networks.
Light and dark, two mirrors of one another.
We have little experience with the upper network or existence, only having taken our first steps into the darker realms.

We must decide where we wish to go.
<We roll for perception:
MC: 10, XP: 14, TH: 18, DB: ??>
We realize we sharing a vision experience with Leyal, beyond just the verbal communication we are having. It reminds us of our interactions with the Dragon (Heston?).

The Lady and the Dragon from our previous visions had the intiial psionic exchange between lifeforms, we are experiencing a similar quickening now.

(We must decide our purpose, our goals, etc.)

TH asks the collective consciousness 'What darkness is on the horizaon for us?'
Leyal says 'I am not that kind of Oracle, man...'

TH asks Leyal if she knows about MccQuaid.
"What do you seek to know?"
"Everyone is afraid of him, but he seems ot be guiding us towards something. Is he of ill intent or not?"
She says McQuaid has been around for almost 2 decades, and he is on the side fighting the darkness.
MC asks Leyal if she knows how to contact McQuiad?
"You abilities in this type of communication sharing is rudimentary. Eventually you will be able to contact him at will. Last time we came through the pool of ichor and carnage to contact him, that was like his front porch so to speak.
For now, that is still the best way to reach him for now.

---

### DAY 23F (2022.07.23)

[Long reflection on journey up to now and current party inventry, equipemnt, capabilities. We are ready to go on some larger journeys!]

_Resuming at the House of a 1000 Faces_

Leal asks us to help find a missing creature, Alibaster skin and silver eyes, hard to describe.
She sends us its name mentally, but it is difficult to translate to common tongue.
He was at the Shrine we were recently near before he went missing.
He was trying to help a refugee we believe.
Leyal turns to leave us and go back to the child.

DB tries to call out to her psycicly (NAT 20), establishing a psychic link voluntarilly to Leyal.
She asks if it is a celestial and what does that mean for us?
Leyal replies to the group verbally.
"This would be a challenge. It is on the Veil's list of things to do. You must use caution as you go. You know what we now. Here are all the images I can give you."
She transmits multiple visuals to us of the creature.

The group has dinner and recounts their recent adventures, discussing the future and possible plans. As the night wears on they begin to discuss their past, revealing deeper secrets to the group about their. Thorune recalls how he was driven from his village, outcast in shame from his tribe for the accidenbt he suffered when younger (when he went into a trance and exploded black lightning - instead of blue - and killed one of his elders). Xanku shares the tale of how he was forced to learn the dark arts of huis villages warring ways, and relished being sent away on his opwn to hunt, buit came back from one such mission to find the village burned to the ground, all slaughtered, the last of his own tribe. Morthos recounts how he never had a tribe or village, as Tieflings are born to humans who often abandon the baby immediately after birth. He himself was one such unwanted child, left on the steps of a small church in a remote fishing village. He was raised by a small coven of nuns (Name??), but eventually he knew he needed to leave their small village and find his own way. He found passage as a crewman aboard a sea-bound ship, endeavoring to become one of the crew - whcih he eventually did - and travelled aboraod for many years learning the wayts of the world before coming to port in NeverWinter to take a break from the seas. The captain he had served under retired, letting loose the crew. Morthos found himself alone and unemployed again in NeverWinter. Donnabella says she is an orphan too, but sasy little else.

Having spoken more openly than usual, the group rests for the night so we can refresh ourselves and heal.

---

### DAY 24A

The next morning we set out for the Shrine ot investigate the missing being. We discuss that they are likely a celestial and that the risk of this adventure poses a higher one than usual. Arriving at the shrine, we investigate the grounds and find little, but within a dried viscous trail of dark liquid leads downward into the shaft below.

Pause here, as it got late, but next time we shall continue the descent into the beckoning darkness belowe...

_END SESSION_

---

### DAY 24B (2022.08.06)

_Resuming from the shrine entrance._

We line up to descend into the shrine.
- Thorune
- Donabella
- Morthos
- Xanku

As we descend, TH senses immediate danger and the smell of fresh death.
We pass more of the bloody viscous stains, drawing our weapons.
Xanku peers into the tunnels ahead, using his rception to see the shadows gathering and moving towards us.
A gigantic mass of merging meat with a toxic avenger-like head begins to appear, speeding towards us as it ffills the hallway.
"Get ready!" TH yells.
MC jumps to the front and pulls the pole of collapsing from within the bag of holding, yelling "extend!".
The pole stretches to split the tunnel in half, the party stepping back a few feet and bracing for impact.
The creature seems to detect the change and slows its forward progress, attempting to utter some sort of word.
It look sover its shoulder as though seeking something or looking for something.
"hHat are you running from, beast?" TH challenges it.
It struggles to make some sort of sound, but is unable to make human words.
DB says it appears to be some sort of a Monstrosity, a construct of some kind being used by someone.
There are still tunnels behind us to the sides that we could use.
In the side forks of the passageways ahead we see another shadow moving.
The beast turns itself to face the shadows.
The group screams in unison, pointing ehind it and saying "Whats that?!"
The meat monster makes a sound towards the shadow.
Halfway up the wall we see a second head.
They begin to grunt and make noises at each other, then join together and begin lumbering forward again.
The group backs up to the stairs and mnorthos extends his magehand (invisible) and grabns the pole.
As he says the word of collapse, the force of the meat beast ejects forward.
Morthos tries to grab the pole, but it strikes him in the hip flexor and spins him (causing 1 DMG).
He recovers and dashes up the stairs behind Xanku.
The group dashes forward into the shrine, TH and XP taking post on the oorway entrances.
DB posts up by teh far wall, near the outer door.
MC runs up and out the front door of the shrine, curving to the north and taking a position to react.
We hear the beats approaching, struggling and smashing their way up teh stairwell.
The scent of death and fetid rot begins to assail our nostrils, DB throwing up a little in her mouth.
The creatures struggle to force themselves through the door, tentacles flailing in a desperate effort to push through. 
A tentacle strikes TH, but does not damage him.
Their skin begins strething and tearing open, red flesh and ooze squirting through ragged tears in its flesh.
One of them begins to enter the room, madness in its eyes as it stares white hot rage at anyting and everything.
MC yells again "DB, euthanize this thing!"
DB implores TH and XP, "Do we need too?"
XP says "No! We dont know its intentions!"
TH, ienraged but holding himself in check, opens his mouth and roars with full dragonborne fury at teh creature.
The creature recoils, but continues pushing through the doorway.
MC screams again "Burn it!"
XP, who is just outside the door, steps out of the way.
The creatures both break free of the tunnel and DB leaps out the door of the shrine.
The beats, an ogrish humanoid monstorsity, swings one of its masive paws at TH  and clobbers him on the head.

TH takes 6 THUNDER DMG and gets slammed into teh outer wall, MM1 & MM2 take 3 THUNDER DMG but remain in place, raging against the sound of the blast as it echoes around the tiny space, smahing glass and trinkets on the alter into a maelstrom of broken shards. DB falls out of the doorway, embarrased by hurting her team mate.

XP SHOOTS ARROW at MM1s head, striking it in the large porkloin sack of meat rot dangling from its neck region, hitting for 6 DAMAGE.

MC DASHES into the SHRINE and ATTACKS MM1 with VAMPIRIC DAGGERS, hitting with one for 4, then the second for 20 (2 + 18 SNEAK ATTACK) DAMAGE. The beast staggers and turns, but is still not bloodied. MC uses his CUNNING ACTION to DISENGAGE and step back out of range with his weapons drawn.

MM1 ATTACKS TH again, hitting him for 10 DAMAGE as he reels against the wall.

MM2 ATTACKS MC, striking with its arms, striking him for 18 BLUDGEONING, but he takes 9 DAMAGE due to WERERAT Resistances.

TH takes the lightning sword and shoves it through the creatures forearm, igniting the sword, and inflicting 9 DAMAGE.

MM2 attacks MC, hitting with both arms for 26 DAMAGE (16 BLUDGEONING DAMAGE + 10 BLUDEGEONING DAMAGE) but he only takes 13 DAMAGE (WERERAT). MC turns and screams "Fuyck you Meat Sausage!" and casts HELLISH REBUKE, striking for 19 FIRE DAMAGE. The creature freaks out, going even crazier in response to the flames, as if terrified of the fire.

MM2 now has DISADVANTAGE no ATTTACK and ABILITY CHECKS.

TH attacks MM2, with ADVANTAGE, hitting for 6 DAMAGE and striking again with his sword for another 13 DAMAGE, stabbing th ecreature deep into its back.

TH slashes at the creatures achilles tendon, HITTING with a CRITICAL STRIKE, slicing it open for 16 DAMAGE, ending the creature. Its body dissolves in a horrid torrent of porkchops and goo, XP fals down atop the massive mound of steaming flesh jelly, waxing skin parchment sticking to his clothing.

### Combat Ends

MC and TH go down the steps and get the collapsing pole.

We use some Healing Spells and potions.
- MC Greater Potion (15 HP) - for 53 HP TOTAL
- TH Superior Potion (25 HP) - for 61 HP TOTAL

Morthos investigates the tunnel, but gets a NAT 1 and sees nothing.
We begin to navigate donw the hallway, eventually comign to teh spot teh ground was torn up by the beast son the pole.
We see shadows up ahead in the distance.
MC signals for the party to stop and sneaks ahead to investigate.
He succesfully sneaks up to the intersection in the tunnel and hears something clicking and clacking, like nails on stone.
Ahead he sees a creature wearing black cloth hovering, pulsating and hovering.
A grotesque bulbous head with a rough top[knoe begins top look out, blue dark skin holding large eyes.
The creature is crouched, hiding its size and dragging its taloned hands along the wall.
She turns and peers directly at Morthos, who withdraws and runs back to the party.

MC tells them that we have another witch hag!
He tells Xanku to take the shot.

We engage in COMBAT!

_END SESSION_

---

### DAY 24C (2022.08.13)

_Resuming from the Hag fight._

We investigate and find nothing specific.
DB does an arcana check and determines that the stone was a magical focus item.
The hag was using it as her magical focus.
She had summoned the "Meat Boys" (the flesh golem creatures).

We can no longer determine if there are any trails of the celestial blood remaining.
Investigation leaves us with no leads.
We are at the Y intersection of the tunnels.

We decide to investigate the other tunnel.
Everyone does very well, though Xanku leans over and farts so hard he almost tears his armor.
Everyone moves slightly away from him.
DB throws up a little in her mouth.
TH says "I thought the meat boy smelled bad!"

We explore both tunnels, investigating about 50-60 feet down the straight tunnel, and find nothing.
We go back down the hag tunnel and find more blood further down the tunnel.
We ready our weapons and continue following the trails of blood.
We pass several passageways that branch off, but we continue to follow the blood.
After a time it starts to fade out.
We end up at another junction and listen.
Ahead we hear something large moving.
We follow the sound forward and begin to enter the cavernous well area that descends into the depths below.
Light is still coming in and reaching several stories into the gaping chasm, fading away in the depths below. There is no detectable bottom.

Morthos sneaks masterfully forward to examine the tunnel entryway.
Signs of life are all around, but there is nothing threatening.
MC signals for the party to remain quiet but follow as he turns to explore further.
Creeping slowly around the left curve, MC notices thatwhen TH makes a small noise, there are hints of movement that stop in response.
MC signals the group to be quiet and motions towards the motion, then conitnues forward.
About 25 feet around teh curve he can just peek around the corridor and sees a group of four or five gobline sized creatures, maybe more.
They are not moving much.

MC quietly signals to the group that there are 5 or so creatures ahead.
Continuing to observe the creatures, MC hears a noise across the the chasm "pssst!".
MC looks and sees a small head poeeking above a stone ledge.
MC sneaks over around the chasm and approache sthe figure.
A small bespectabled man is suyrprised to see him.
"You're not who I thought you were. WHat are you doing here?"
MC says "What are you doing here?"
"Fig: "This place is unsafer. You shouldn't be here. Don't you see tha pack od Kobolds?"
MC "We are looking for someone. We are looking for an injured celestial that we believe was abducted and brought through this way. Have you seen one?"
His eyes snap back to MC and  he says "Seriously, whay are you here?"
MC tries to persuade the character of his intentions, then the man cautiously whispers back
"We should discuss this somewhere safer."
MC "Lead the way..."
MC signals to the group he is going to follow the man, and signals the group to also follow.

The group sneaks around the chasm and can not see MC.

### COMBAT

**Initiative**

- Momster 18 (est)
- MC 15 (est)

MC suddenly breaks free from being grappled by ...something....
It was like being inside a bag of holding, only to barely escape.
MC turns to see the creature metamorphosing into the man shape.
He leaps at MC and attacks, hitting for 17 SLASHING DAMAGE with a dagger.
MC is now in COMBAT!

_back to the group_

Th party cannot find MC, but TH uses PERCEPTION and hears scuffling some 30 feet ahead in the darkness.
TH tells the group "I hear a scuffle"
The pary follows at a quicked pace.

_back to MC_

MC Attacks Mr. Gropely, but misses.
MC uses his bonus action to disengage and move back away towards where the party was.

_joined_

The party arrives at the same time and sees the figure walking calmly towards MC.
TH steps forward ith his sword, challengin him by saying "What in sweet Phandolin's boohole is going on here!"
(The boo-hole is where the ghost of last nights dinner comes from).

**Initiative**

- DB 14
- XP 14
- TH 3

DB fires Eldritch Blast but misses.

XP fires his bow, striking the creature for 5 DMG (2 PIERCING + 3 POISON).

TH raises his sword and slashes two-handed at the creatures neck, striking the beast deeply in the neck - inflicting 10 DMG - but the creature diffuses, its flesh morphiong then snapping back together, pushing the blade free of its flesh. For his second attack, TH stabs at it but is blocked by the otherworldy creature.

#### ROUND 1

GUY: pull sout a small bone whistle and blows a haunting high pitch, and in the distance we hear the horde of hobgoblins respond.

MC looks at the party, DB points towards the circular stairs and says "Find aother way!".
He turns to dash, and the rest follow.

GUY takes an ATTACK of OPPORTUNITY on TH and hist for 7 DMG.

The party runs back into the hub then dashes down a side hallway, putting distance between the party and the group of monsters.

The hobgoblins try to cut us off, but are too slow, and we get free of them.
We make it back to where we slew the hag the night before, and on to the shrine entrance.
We run out of the shrine and turn to assess our followers.

MC says "CLoud of Daggers the exit?"
TH says "Save it..." then steps forward and yells "Fire in the Draghonhole!", tossing a bead of force into the entrance.
It explodes for 14 FORCE DAMAGE, knocking a large chunk of the stpes loose, creating difficult terrain.

DB casts Cloud of Daggers over the explosion.

MC readies a Bead of Force and repares to throw it at the first creature he sees.

#### ROUND 2

There is a wet meat sound, a strange gurgle and dark wet chunks of flesh erupt forward from the cloud of daggers. KOBOLD 1 is dead.

KOBOLD 2 repeats, a slightly lighter shade of ooze spurting from the cloud.

KOBOLD 3 is dragged into the cloud, ripping his face apart form the bottom up, ripping it from his body, then rendering his limbs flying.

Confused noises and chatter comes from below, the creatures within waiting to see what happens next.

MC turns to DB and says "Watch this!", then throws the Force Bead into the tunnel entrance, exploding with 14 FORCE DAMAGE, hitting KOBOLD 4 hit for 7, KOBOLD 5 got hit for 7. He readies the second Force Bead and waits.

DB approaches the CLOUD of DAGGERS and slowly moves into the cloud, controlling them so they do not harm her, and casts ELDRITCH BLAST - but misses. She steps out of the cloud and readies herself.

XP casts THORNS and inflicts KOBOLD 4, KOBOLD 5 and another creature, inflicting 3 DAMAGE and reducing theior movement by half for the duration.

TH steps up and says "My turn!" and throws another FOrce Bead into the entrance, farther in this time. It explodes with a muffled sound within, and their is a wounded noise within.

#### ROUND 3

The KOBOLDS 4 & 5 attempt to rip themselves free, but are impaled by the thorn fopr 4 DMG each, falling over dead on the writhing vines.

There is a wet clicking sound from within the hallway, something approaching the entrance.
The creature struggles across the thorny ground, taking 5 DMG in its struggle.

MC steps forward and casts FIRE BOLT at the creature within, hitting it for 19 FIRE DAMAGE.

GUY loses all semblance of human and stretches into a strange putrescent black and leather creature. It is hurt, but angered.

DB drops the CLOUD of DAGGERS, the silence deafening as she takes a good look at the creature. She grasps her tome and leather band, looking downward as dark black and purple tentacles erupt from her body. She accidentally cast the spell next to th eparty, causing everyone to have tyo make a STR ST and avoid. Everyone succeeds except MC, who takes 8 NECROTIC DMG and is unable to take a reaction on huis next turn). TH and XP take 4 NECROTIC DMG. As she realizes her mistake, she drops the spell.

XP maintains the TANGLED VINES and shoots his bow at the creature, hitting it for 7 PIERCING DAMAGE and 4 COLOSSUS SLAYER, killing the beast.The arrow pierces the beast at the base of its throat, its flailing arms  dropping to the earth slowly as it dies.

### END COMBAT

LOOT!

- 3 GP
- 10 Copper

We examine the creature and determine it is some sort of ShapeShifter.
There is no sign of the strange bone whistle form before.

We return to the House of 1000 Faces, where we clean he filth from ourselves.
After we refresh and dine, we meet in the common room.
MC talks to Arlef on the sly, then the party joins.
We seek Leal, but she is out on assignment.

Arlef says the black blue blood could be related to the hags we fought.
There is some kind of force edging its way in and there are people disappearing, presumed murdered for use in ritual sacrifices.

He asks if there was any sign of the celestial, we say no we thought the blood was the celestials. We show him the wet jewel, which he examines carefully. He says he knows not about this, but he does ask about the Meat Boys we encountered and its source or creator. Then he asks about the shapeshifter. After we explain it he sauys he thinks it was a Doppleganger. It sounds like the form it assumed might have been a Ranger scout they sent through with the Celestial.

We explain the behavior of the kobolds as well, finding it odd. Arlef says he is unaware of any Dopplegangers who run things, they are usually used for wet work activity or assassin work.

The party continues to drink.
MC gives TH the bag of holding because he does not want to lose it.
MC & DB get stumbling drunk, falling down multiple times:
- MC takes 5 BLUDGEONING DAMAGE
- DB takes 3 BLUDGEONING DAMAGE
XP is calmly smoking his pipeweed.
TH drinks slowly and remains calm.
The night draws on into the late hours...

The Adventure continues in "The Phandolin Four Saga: Chapter 6".
